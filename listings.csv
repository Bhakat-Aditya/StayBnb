Plenty of communal space in the indoor/outdoor living area, lovely big pool, free cold filtered water, and the wifi is pretty strong as I was able to work remote while there.  We had a cleaning every two days, which kept the place neat and tidy. Since it is indoor/outdoor living, there are some ants but that is expected.  There are loads of restaurants nearby, though it can be a bit hectic walking around as there are no footpaths (but this is Canggu in general). We did discover a more direct/easier/safer walk to the main street on our second day, if you walk out towards the Montessori school and through the park across it, it will take you to the main street within 5 minutes walking (right near Hungry Bird cafe).

Some things to replace. Toilet seats, kitchen,This was a beautiful place to stay. Felt so relaxed here and yet there is plenty to do nearby. The house is cleaned spotless every day and very well maintained. The pool is gorgeous although a bit cold. The roof is a great place to tan and relax. I love the beds outside that is such a nice touch, and the indoor/ outdoor living is so cool! We were so excited when we first arrived we jumped up and down. It is such a beautiful house. One thing to note is there is construction going on all around the house. The view from the roof is mostly construction sites and they begin in the morning, which is a bit annoying.,Actually its really great place to stay, close to the beach, close from restaurants and alot unique things inside the house. but all of the stuff is dirty by dust. Maybe from the construction behind villa. the Gas stove not working,  I really wish it will be work bcz I want to cook some dinner. When I told the host, she said someone will coming and fix it, but its not . The hot water button from dispenser not working. TV not working. You should bring your own shampoo and liquid bodywash bcz they only give you tiny little bar soap. Somuch stain in sofa and cooking utensils.,Good,Great villa in the best location,Great location,Great place next to all of the fun clubs and restaurants!,Nice and quiet ,relaxing,The check in was easy and smooth, July was available for any question prior our stay and during our stay. The villa is very well located, 5 min walk from the beach and there are a lot of places to eat nearby,It was a great location in a great place. It's all a little dated. Kitchen moderately equipped with crockery etc. If you stay with 6 it is really too little. Bedlinen and bath towels are in need of renewal. The neighbors on both sides were renovating which was quite disturbing in the morning. July took immediate action on that, so they started later in the morning.,Villa located in a quiet area but close to everything beach and restaurants within walking distance. The rooftop terrace with a view of Canggu and the indoor pool to the house is priceless. I recommend it for those who want to stay in Canggu but stay away from noise and chaos while having everything at your fingertips.,Very nice villa which is in a perfect location in Canggu. The only downside is that there are whole cattle mosquitoes in the living room near the pool.,Everything is perfect, amazing location to reach the beach on foot. Perfect for surfing,Perfect location in Canggu and walkable distance to both beach and cafes. Everything in Canggu is within 5-10 mins on a scooter. <br/>On top, the villa is always clean and shiny thanks to July‚Äôs cleaning day coming by everyday. We loved every day and stayed for a week.,A wonderful stay in Canggu! The place is in a great location and very spacious. It was a good stay for six people. I will say the photos do not exactly match the way it looks any more. The photos were definitely taken when the place was new as the aesthetics have changed and there is definitely wear and tear on the place that is noticeable. A new layer of paint is definitely needed and new bedding as the sheets were old with stains on them. Other than that, it was a good stay in a great location!,July‚Äôs home in Canggu is beautiful and an ideal location for a holiday in Bali. The area around is not too built up so it still feels like Indonesia, but it has enough around the villa that it feels central. All rooms were air-conned & always kept clean by the great cleaner. The pool was great and my family throughly enjoyed staying there and would return! Fat mermaid nearby is a great restaurant & beach is minutes away. <br/>The only slight cons we had while staying here was the Wi-Fi not stretching to all the rooms, would be great to have an additional box to cover the whole house. Lots of mosquitoes in the living room area, of course as it is open plan with no roof (expected) & the kitchen was not the best equipped for cooking.,loved our stay here. excellent location, lots of space in the villa and lots of good spots within walking distance,Overall did the job and a good central location, good comms from the host.<br/>Noticeably ages and in need of some tlc.

The pool was amazing and the beach was just a short stroll down the road. Would stay here again.,The check in was really smooth and clear communicated by July. Any additional request such as towels or water have been provided within 24h. Canggu beach is just a 4min walk away from the Villa with lots of cafes, restaurants and shops close by. The fat mermaid was a pleasure to have next door as it has great food and exceptional service. <br/>I would book anytime again!<br/>Thank you July!,This is a great place. It is easy to find: just next to the Fat Mermaid cafe.<br/>The owner provides a hotel style villa, you get tissue paper, towels, soap, hand sop, power adapters and etc. There is one water dispenser, so we don't need buy a lot of water from outside.<br/>Great place to stay.,Very well priced! <br/>July provided details for Putuk, a local driver that she recommends. Putuk collected us from the airport and took us to the villa.

Great location.<br/>Would of liked cleaning everyday not every second day. Overall I would stay at this  listing again. Perfect for families.,We stayed at the apartment with our children (10 and 12 years old). <br/>The apartment is very practically furnished with lots of storage space. From the small balcony you can see the sea on the side. In the evening, it was noisy from the neighboring music bar until about 11 pm. But then it was quiet all night and until later in the morning. <br/>The associated resort with a large swimming pool is a bit outdated but still acceptable. Many families with children were to be found. <br/>The lively environment with the many shops and restaurants offers something for everyone. But the most beautiful is the nearby beach with the impressive waves and famous sunset. It goes in flat in the water and the waves break far out so the swimming is relatively safe. <br/>The bathroom should be a little cleaner. The sheets had yellow stains, but seemed to be washed clean. Probably from a guest who made new actioners.,overall good.<br/>shower of one bathroom needs repair.,Overall, this was not an enjoyable stay. Off the bat we noticed large stains on the sheets and pillows in both bedrooms. The shower in the second bedroom was cold and had zero pressure so we could not to use for the rest of the trip. The lock was not secure. Upon request the sheets were changed and a bolt was added however this led to another issue ‚Äî Magdalena did not communicate properly and someone entered the Airbnb while we were away without telling us. <br/>In terms of location, if you are familiar with this area and know you like it ‚Äî great. Otherwise, if you are young, American, or new to Bali, do not stay around here. The beach is dirty and filled with vendors. We were catcalled every time we walked outside the Jayakarta complex. The pool is crowded and loud. The jayakarta security and desk refused to help with an aggressive taxi driver despite us being within the complex when the incident took place. We ended up leaving two days early. Buyer beware - I would NOT stay here.,Good,We liked the accommodation very much and the pool area was very nice.<br/>In addition, the apartment was well protected from insects and if you always close the balcony doors, there is really no animal coming in. So we have not had any mosquito bites, etc.<br/>The rooms were beautifully modern and just like the pictures.<br/>Overall, we loved the stay! :),We‚Äôve stayed in the private apartments at the Jayakarta before so knew what to expect for location. The room is a great size, Magdalena‚Äôs room was better then the previous room we stayed in. It‚Äôs more modern in the bathrooms. The noise at night time though is very loud, I knew to expect some noise but it was louder then expected. We could hear the songs word for word and it goes every single night till midnight. Which isnt ideal when you have young children like us. Otherwise I could deal with it. <br/>I wasn‚Äôt happy when my baby had a poo accident on the doona cover and instead of housekeeping changing the bedding they just flipped the blanket over so it couldn‚Äôt be seen. Cleaning could of been better. <br/>Overall though we enjoyed our stay as location is perfect and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about for us.

Hot and strong shower üöø close to shops, walkable within 10 mins to everything.,Ariasa is very friendly and the place is very comfortable.,Cheap place to stay in Kuta with friendly and helpful hosts. I Recommend,The host was good. The place was also not bad. Mostly everything was ok only. The major problem was the bathroom. Unless and until you are a tiny person you CAN NOT fit into the toilet seat. You have to sit side wise always. And if you are little plump then I really don‚Äôt know how you can adjust. The commode is cramped between two walls. Two small problems- Wi-Fi is weak  n the property is in an extreme corner of an alley. Little away from the action.,Just a very nice place to stay,Ariasa is a lovely person who is always there to help. The place is clean and beautiful. Totally recommended,The host is quick to respond to messages and very helpful to my enquiries. Very nice that there is a fridge and even a TV. The bathroom is clean and the door has some hooks to hang stuff. She provided two bottles of water. Would be nice to have a common area to boil hot water for kopi or to be able to fill up the water bottle.  Overall very clean, comfortable and peaceful stay!,Ariasa‚Äôs place is a gem in the heart of Kuta ! Place is conveniently located, only a short walk from the beach and the main busy streets of the city. Property is very private and calm, the only things you will hear are the roosters in the morning and some barking from the dogs in the neighborhood, but it didn‚Äôt bother us. The room is exactly as in the pictures, the bed is big and comfy, we slept so well there. Bathroom is really clean, there‚Äôs a wardrobe for your clothes/suitcases, and a little fridge for water, fruits‚Ä¶<br/>Ariasa made our trip even better ! She‚Äôs a warm and welcoming woman, who will introduce you to the culture of her country. We were invited to ceremonies and always had great talks with her. She is so interesting to know and it was amazing meeting her. The dog of the property, Jecky, will be protective in the beginning and might bark at you. But don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs a big soft sweetie who will even let you pet him after a while. <br/>We‚Äôll definitely stay there again ! :),super,I stayed 1 month here in July/August and gave Yuni and her place \Ariasa House\ 5 stars because the option represented good value for the price and Yuni was a very friendly and supportive host. Here are my pros and cons. I have stayed in Bali guesthouses for over a year now and am also a Superhost so I know the market well.<br/>Pros: <br/>1. Clean and friendly place<br/>2. Great host (TV was missing from room and she replaced it quickly/ she also helped me get a 20 L bin of water for my stay)<br/>3. Nice balcony overlooking garden to have meals<br/>4. Good natural light, bed and shower<br/>5. Price was economical.<br/>Cons:<br/>1. Room was small (but still good size relative to price)<br/>2. Jacky, the quite big house dog, barked and showed more aggressive behavior than other dogs at other guesthouses I have been at. This lasted for about a week. After, he was used to me and my girlfriend. <br/>3. Roosters at \neighbor's house\ woke me up early (I am a light sleeper).<br/>4. Some \minor\ stains on the wall but reasonable.,We stayed at Ariasa's for a month, everything matched the photos, the apartment was close to the beach perfect for surfing! <br/>Ariasa was very kind and courteous to us!<br/> For those who want to stay in Bali with an essential stay, this apartment is perfect!,The room is very clean, there are occasional ants, except the room is a little small, the dogs in the yard are a bit fierce, everything else is pretty good.,Nice place to stay for a few nights. The hosts were really friendly and you immediately felt really welcomed.,basic room with fridge and all you need for some time in Kuta. convenient location, 15min walking from the beach. very nice host family.,Stayed for a night, good value place,Great location,Lovely stay, very hygienic room, tasty vegetarian breakfast also given when asked.

All in all, I was very satisfied.,One word: a dream. The house was beautifully designed, centrally located with every thing close by. Most importantly it had the best vibe. The pool, garden and all the plants were a treat for the eyes. Safira was so helpful with everything and made the house feel so warm. I will come here again for sure.,My stay at agate villa was perfect, i stayed with 2 friends for 2 nights, it was the perfect location for food and walking distance to convince stores. <br/>Communication with safira was so smooth she answered all questions we had extremely quickly. <br/>Such a beautiful brand new villa, we couldn't find anything to complain about if we wanted. Thank you so much for a lovely stay safira, we will definitely be back!,The villa needs a lot of maintainence (when we checked in  the water in both bathrooms were running small & cable TV was not working properly).<br/>I called Safira (the host) for water and Cable TV problems and those got fixed in the next day. It would be better if she could have checked everything before letting the guests in.<br/>I stayed for 4 nights with 6 adults (Safira managed to put 2 extra beds in one of the Bed Rooms during short notice. This is the only plus point I could give to the service.)<br/>The villa was NOT intended to be cleaning every day; towel was NOT intended to change regularly (we had a new bath towel but has a stain on it-So I had to ask Safira for an exchange again).  If daily cleaning is an important matter for you, you need to make it clear w/ the host before you make a reservation.<br/>The villa is in Canggu area; it has many cafes and restaurants nearby and can be accessible by walking (Butterman, Pepita & Sons, Warung Goathe etc).,A great experience with this Superhost!<br/>Everything was a breeze and a lot of work. We arrived and were very well received. The villa is super comfortable for a stay with family or even a small group of friends. It is also well located, with good restaurants and cafes in the area. <br/>Safira is very helpful and is always there if we need her. So to summarize, everything was great.üíõ‚ú®,Beautiful villa..,The property is new, and very cozy.<br/>The location also superb, you can go to one of the best restaurant (Warung Gouthe) by walking distance. <br/>The facilities and amenities are all there. You named it, it‚Äôs all there within the property.<br/>Surprisingly, this villa has parking space and it fits with big cars.<br/> <br/>But for those who wants a villa located in the valley, or short walk to beach or maybe rice paddies view with tremendous distance between other villas, this is not the place. Since it‚Äôs not the area. But I think Safira has other property that suits your needs.<br/>On the other hand, this villa is very recommended and amazing. <br/>What makes the property amazing actually is the host. <br/>Safira really treats my family very nice. She‚Äôs very kind by nature and the communication before our stay is beyond our expectations. She even ask to communicates with my wife since we bring our 2y.o daughter. <br/>I‚Äôd say Comfort is her priority towards her guests, and that‚Äôs what we feel during our stays.",3.5,-8.6515,115.1496,2,TRUE,"Entire villa,1 bed,1 bath","Check-in after 2:00 PM,Checkout before 11:00 AM,2 guests maximum","Fast wifi,value:At 67 Mbps, you can take video calls and stream videos for your whole group.,Self check-in,value:Check yourself in with the lockbox.,Safira is a Superhost,value:Superhosts are experienced, highly rated Hosts.",Stylish 2 AGATE 1 Bedroom ViLLa in Central Berawa,45298,India

Avoid giving fragile clothes, and remember to check all items when brought back to you to make sure nothing is missing or damaged.‚Ä¢ SHOULD I EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER MOSQUITOES, INSECTS OR OTHER ANIMALS?Bali being a tropical Island, mosquitoes & insects are everywhere. While we do organize fogging twice per month to limit as much as possible their number, we do advise guest to bring their own mosquito repellent, or use the ones provided at the villa if any. it is also common to spot other exotic animals (lizards, bats, ants etc), especially in gardens & open spaces. All of which are harmless, and part of local everyday life.","Very nice and cozy villa. Everything is new, fresh. Nice little courtyard, as well as an outdoor shower. Beautiful, Balinese style. On application, you can send a chef who will cook breakfast right in your villa. You can also call a massage therapist. Huge comfortable bed. A huge wild clean black sand beach is a 5-minute walk away. During the day there are almost no people on this beach, a couple of times we were alone on the beach. The waves are big, you can't really swim, but you can frolic in the waves. For us personally, this beach seemed the most beautiful of all we were in Bali. There are practically no tourists in the area, mostly locals relax here. Of the disadvantages, it can be noted that it is a little noisy (there is construction nearby, as well as the villa is next to a large parking lot). And also keep in mind that this location is remote from shops/restaurants, etc. The nearest grocery stores are a 10-minute drive/bike away, and Canggu is about 25-30 minutes away. It takes about an hour and a half to drive from the airport for traffic jams. You won't get anywhere on foot,The villa itself was beautiful, sorry that the listing does not mention that the parking of beachclub Luna is right in front of the door and from where the shuttle bus leaves. This provides the necessary noise until very late.. Maybe this is just ideal for other travelers, but for us this took a lot off our stay. There is also a large construction site that provides the necessary noise during the day.<br/>If we had known this in advance, we could have made other choices.<br/>Too bad,Lovely stay! Really caring and friendly staff/communication was great if we needed anything. Would 100% recommend. Such a lovely villa! Thanks for a great stay :),The most incredible stay. It was beautiful, private, quiet and unbelievably relaxing. It‚Äôs super near Canguu and Pererenan - 10 minute drive. I loved that it was a tiny bit further out as I got to enjoy riding the bike into town. As well as enjoy the peaceful area it was located in. It was a couple minutes walk from an incredible beach club called Luna - a must go. We felt so looked after with the 24/7 concierge. The speed of the replies were unmatched. It was lovely we met the host called Prilla who was super lovely. She greeted us on our arrival at 11pm and made sure we were settled. She came and visited us when we needed her. I couldn‚Äôt have felt more at home and I highly recommend this villa. It was exactly as described but even better! Thank you so much for an incredible stay!,Great spot!,The villa was exactly like the photos, beautiful and clean. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a lovely lady named Prila, who facilitated our check-in and offered a refreshing welcome drink after our long trip from the airport, courtesy of the management arranged by Max who was a very responsive host and provided clear communication. <br/>The villa's location was beautiful, surrounded by lush green fields and conveniently close to the main road leading to popular areas like Canggu and Seminyak. A short 2-minute ride away was Luna Beach Club, easily accessible via a free shuttle bus located across from the villa. The peaceful setting, away from noisy traffic, added to the overall charm of the place. <br/>The villa itself was perfect, featuring a pristine bedroom and a stunning outdoor bathroom. The pool area, enveloped by tropical plants, exuded a very peaceful atmosphere. I highly recommend this villa for its accurate descriptions, tranquil location, and all the amenities it has to offer!,it's a very pleasant and peaceful villa to spend your holidays and rest fully,<br/>the concierge service is very responsive and efficient, always attentive,<br/>we loved staying at this place,Gorgeous place, had everything I needed! Would definitely stay again, the staff were so lovely.,The villa was exactly as it appeared in the pictures. We felt very comfortable. The atmosphere was also very relaxed in the evening as the pool was beautifully lit. We arrived at night, but despite this, check-in went smoothly. To cool down a little, we were given a delicious lemon water and a refreshing towel. To get around, we were able to rent scooters from Prila, who met us there. The rental was very relaxed as they brought them to our door and picked us up again from there. We had a great time and will consider booking the accommodation on our next trip to Bali. Thank you very much,Great airbnb!,very nice and clean villa, staff always available for anything you need.,Beautiful villa retreat situated in a peaceful neighborhood near Nyanyi beach.

Location is great - no noisy crowds. Everything was new. The host was ready to help all the time. They even had cleaning during our stay! Thanks to guys our vacation was incredible! The beach nearby was good and not a lot of people on it. But quite wavy)<br/>There was a construction works nearby but for active holiday we didn‚Äôt even notice them. <br/>Thanks to Max and Putu! That was really great time! <br/>Definitely recommend this place! 100000%!,Our stay at Maxime's place was great. <br/>We had initially rented another accommodation that had turned out to be an absolute disaster after our arrival. In the short term we found Maxim's villa and were able to check in directly. Everything went smoothly and we were immediately looked after. <br/>The villa is very new and beautiful. Due to the private pool and the high wall, you have your privacy and tranquility. There is a kitchen with fridge, as well as a water machine where you can always tap into ice-cold water. A beach nearby is easily accessible. Through the pleasant scooter rental, where the scooter is brought directly to you, everything else is also quickly accessible. <br/>We loved it and would be happy to come back!,Had wonderful days in the villa. Everything was neat and comfortable. Cleaning was done daily and the host makes sure everything is up to you,villa karina was exactly as shown in the photos.<br/>The location is a little outskirts, but I think the advantage was better for relaxing. <br/>I loved everything I did at this accommodation. I really want to go back.,Amazing Villa, close to the beach where you can have a beautiful sunsets. <br/>I‚Äôve spent there 19 days and I am pretty happy with my stay. <br/>It‚Äôs a bit noisy during the days because of reconstruction around but I knew it before I‚Äôve rented that place so it didn‚Äôt bother me.<br/>I would not say it‚Äôs very private because cleaning lady came every day for a few hours, gardener and a pool guy as well. But they were nice. <br/>The pool area is good and clean, kitchen is perfect. It would be nice to have a big  mirror at the Villa as well. <br/>Definitely can recommend this place to my friends.,Great place. Very peaceful at night.

Doni's place with several houses in the shared garden ( with swimming pool) is in the middle of Denpasar, but still has peace and quiet . A great end to our vacation,We absolutely enjoyed our stay at the Villas! We also have a combination of privacy with our 3 bedroom and a large living room to relax, but also with the amenities of a beautiful pool, bar, loved the coffee every morning from the bar, and the option to have a nice relaxing pace without getting out of the Villa. Grab easily arrives to the door of the Villa when ordering food or groceries. There are plenty of coffee shops to walk and even restaurants with playgrounds just 1 minute away walking distance. We really enjoyed this place and the bunny James, turtles, and the treat of being surrounded by the beautiful setting was excellent!,This property is great for a break away from the hustle and bustle. Beautiful property & great staff.,Great host and a wonderful place for a relaxed vacation for the family. They are very helpful and super efficient. Thanks Doni!!!,I stayed here with my colleagues for a \work from villa\ experience for a few days. This place is suitable to have a work and play balance. The garden and pool helps us to focus and relax. Not many power outlet though and it's a bit hot to hang around in the living room during day time. Otherwise it's a nice place.,Good staff and good villa,Loved the stay! Beautiful place and very kind people :) will be back again, thank you Doni!,Great place as seen in the pics. Very hard working friendly staff always greeting us with a smile. Nice large villa which had plenty of room for my family of 5(2adults 3kids) with a nice common area for us all to chill... On a bad note, Wifi was cutting out often and was off half a day at one time. We also hired a chef for one day(2 meals) recommended by the villa which was to cost us 550IDR for his services. We were to pay for groceries plus a 20% surcharge on top of grocery cost which was fair enough. The food was good but he made enough to feed 10 people for both meals and the total bill came to over 2,000,000IDR which was very frustrating at the least and put me off a bit... Please dont get me wrong, its a really nice place with some good shops like coffee/meassges etc just down the road. All the best.,Nice but basic accomodation. Walking with children to restaurants close by was hazardous with traffic in the absence of footpaths (this is the case in other parts of Bali). Hygiene and cleanliness of accomodation could have been better. Staff & owners generally quite friendly and genuine. Facility could benefit from more hands on management.,The most beautiful and incredible house that me and my friends ever had. Doni and his family were kind, friendly and helpful a lot. It was the first time when you check in somewhere and find new friends at the begging of the journey. :)This villa is wonderful, cosy and stylish. Seems like we lived in a fairytale. :) The house was suuuuuuper spacious enough for 3 people with lots of luggage. There are 3 absolutely stylish and super cosy bedrooms, one huge living room with a kitchen and all the appliances. Every bedroom has own beautiful bathroom and that was so necessary for girlish morning rituals :) Everyone gets his own space :) Wonderful backyard and so cosy neighborhood. Ahh, by the way, there is an awesome swimming pool in front of the villa. We spent a lot of time around our home and discovered a lot of beautiful places. You can go to the beach by foot or use gojek or order a motorbike, if you want to visit all the beaches around. But anyway, everything that you need is in a walking distance. Big thanks to Doni for being a great host and Anty for the best bali coffee in the world every morning :) Gonna highly recommend Doni and his villa! :),We really enjoyed our stay in Sejoli villa. The guest house is beautiful and clean. We really appreciated the excellent service during our stay. The hosts, Doni and his wife, were warm and kind.

Will definitely recommend to friends and come again.,I liked the place more and more as my four weeks progressed. The hosts are amazing, the house cleaner is wonderful, and the neighborhood is friendly. I soon found my favorite coffee (Bold, a 5 minute walk), favorite massage (just down the street), etc. It wasn‚Äôt long before this felt like home. <br/>The house is comfortable, a tad worn, but in a relaxing way. The bedrooms are all equipped with good a/c. I spent many hours poolside in the comfortable chairs and pleasant courtyard.

Flexible with our late check-in and early check-out as well as very responsive to our needs. She supplied us with snacks, welcome drinks, and clean drinking water. The house was very large, and we all had our own bathrooms. However, the house is very old and needs some updates. Bedroom #3, behind the pool, was concerning because there is a puddle of water that forms in front of it every night. My friend nearly slipped every morning coming out of her room. The bathroom showers were falling apart and not very clean, but we made do. Merrie provided a 5 gallon water cooler for us so we can have fresh drinking water, which I was very grateful for. However, the spouts were dirty, and I feel that is something that should be maintained. There is a housekeeper that comes during the week, which was great. However, I noticed she never cleaned the toilets. There are no spare keys to the safes, so I wouldn't use them in case you lose the key.,Clean and great hospitality. Felt like home..,We loved Merrie‚Äôs Summer house! It was beautiful and relaxing. It was close to everything. Merrie and Rudi were approachable helped us whenever we had questions even when they are in a vacation. The housekeeper, Maria, was so kind and she kept everything clean and tidy for us.

If you will face with this such a case inform us and we will make an additional cleaning as fast as we can.In every Balinese house or villa from time to time, you can notice lizards. They usually appear on the walls and ceilings and can spend hours there, expect different small insects. In most cases, they have a size of up to 10 centimeters but sometimes they can be bigger. They are not dangerous and are a part of the Balinese cultural identity. Because of that, you can often see the lizard symbols on the gates and walls of Balinese houses. According to some traditions, the lizards in the house are a symbol of family happiness and harmony. Please note, we can do nothing about lizards and they live outside or in small cracks and can always penetrate the house. The deletion of one of them doesn't lead to their absence. After an absence for a day or even a few hours, that's quite likely that you will find traces of the presence of the lizards (dust, small lumps of earth, waste products) on the surface of the floors, chairs, beds, and tables. If you found such traces and need help, inform us and we will make an extra cleaning.","It was a lovely stay , definitely my favorite stay in Canggu :),An amazing guest house, few details and it‚Äôll be perfect to stay at,Nice place! Good location. Very quiet and peaceful with a lot of plants in the garden. Room was comfy and I love the natural light in the bathroom. I will come back for sure!,Everything from check in, instructions on the room lock, and recommendations was very smooth and detailed. The pool was very clean and perfect for a swim in the afternoon. There were many nearby convinience stores such as M mart and Circle K which makes it easily accessible. Host was very responsive and friendly too!,A pleasant stay, the room was clean and the pool area was very nice. Has a small kitchen accessible to everyone really great for cooking. I would highly recommend it!,Everything is good, we are staying here for the second time,The pool was magnificent, the room was nice, very nice service for the price. We loved it, the pool was really clean,Great guest house! Just a godsend for the price. We stayed here for 5 days and would love to come here again next time. Convenient location, a lot of cafes and restaurants nearby. The area is away from the road, which makes the place to stay quiet. Great pool, really comfortable bed and kitchen where you can cook,I liked it) Peaceful place with no noise. Housekeeping 2x per week. Everything is clean.,Had a great time at this quiet corner. Responsive and listening host added to his hospitality,Okey for the money paid. Kitchen utensils could be more cleaner (they need to work on this). No space for Car Park if you intend to hire one getting there.,I will definitely recommend this beautiful place to stay!,Stayed here for a month and here are my honest reviews:<br/>PROS:<br/>location - it's superb. The place is quiet and it's close to some of the best places to visit.<br/>pool & garden- are nice and well maintained.  <br/>room - airconditioning and room size is good for two. bedsheets are replaced weekly.  <br/>and the cat.<br/>CONS:<br/>maintenance/cleanliness - kitchen, room and bathroom need serious cleaning and replacing. The shower head is calcified, the wall in the room is breaking out, and stains can be seen on the curtain and toilet sink. The kitchen utensils can be improved.<br/>ants and other insects - it's everywhere. You can find them while showering and especially while cooking. <br/>Security/Assistance - I lost my helmet in the parking lot and asked the host if he can check the CCTV so I can also explain to the motorbike rental what happened. Putu said he'll check but he stopped replying after multiple follow-ups. Ended up paying more extra just because I couldn't get help with the CCTV.,Lovely room and lovely staff,Everything was good, fine deal for the price, except the fact that towels only changed once a week, which I think is way to seldom for most people, I didn't raise this issue, because I did shower in the gym or at a beach club mostly, but I have no idea how can it be enough for others. If you stay at Room 5 and are at least somewhat sensitive to noises - water pump can drive you mad. I never sleep with earplugs, but I had to do it here, because there is a sound from the waterpump every 20 sek or so.<br/>Location is good, I like Berawa, both Seminyak and Canggu are close. <br/>Friendly owner and staff.,Swimming pool is good!,If you are light sleeper houses 5 and 6 are not for you. They have water pumps for each house side and they are right behind those houses. We were unlucky enough to stay in #5 and had hard time sleeping with the noise. Of course,stopping the water pump is not going to fix the issue as simply Noone will have water,we get that. But we had to be swapped with another quiter room if such were present.<br/>Or it should be made visible that #5 and #6 are coming with this disadvantage. In order not to be left with a bad surprise.<br/>On the other hand the place allows you meet lots of folks from all over the world which we found really pleasant.<br/>The pools is good.<br/>Room cleaning happens on Wednesday and Friday but if you're leaving a day before any of those you won't get it.,Thanks so much! I called this place home for 3 months and felt so safe and very looked after when i had any questions.,This place is a hidden gem. It‚Äôs a quiet oasis right next to the hustle and bustle of the busy streets. <br/>The natural light in the rooms is my favorite part. The hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful with any and all thing we needed help with.,Awesome place! I recommend it....,All good, easy to find, enough signs, even though host sends alerts that you need to take transfer from guest house.,Can highly recommend! :-),We are traveling for 9 months and stayed in alot of airbnb...this was by far the most beautiful place we stayed in.

It was very quiet and relaxing yet you are near the buzz in Seminyak.,The Villa really is becoming part of the beautiful moment in our recent visit to Seminyak Bali. <br/>We really like the ambience, the cleanliness, the hospitality, and of course the location which is so strategic for us to visit some of the interesting places around Seminyak.,Lovely villa but needs updating.

The house managers were wonderful and made our trip so easy and took care of us when one of us had a little accident with a sea urchin!

Worth the money.,Spacious villa with clean private pool. My children was so excited. Mas Yogi is kind and supportive person. Thank you for being nice host, mas Yogi.,We stayed here for a couple of days and the place was amazing. We actually extended for another night. Yogi was great the entire time,Was as in pictures.. living room open but good rooms and pool,Wasn't great to find the location and the host would have been handy if more name hints were given in the check in hint.<br/>The Host was very nice and responsive.,Thank you, all be goodüëç,Good place and also quite strategic location,Everything was fine thank you.,Firstly, Yogi was a good host with his intentions being in the right place to host us well. Unfortunately, this place needs some real maintenance to match his noble intent!<br/>The bnb is actually at a great location for those who want to be close to the hustle bustle of Seminyak, it‚Äôs very easy to step out and go to best places nearby in Kuta. The rooms are decent size, and similar to the photos.<br/>The only two major issues that we faced are 1. AC quality - even though the ACs were apparently new, somehow, they were ineffective to help us in the unbearable Bali heat. Yogi genuinely tried to help fix them so this might have been a one-off incident, and tbh ACs were kind of awful throughout Seminyak so not sure if it‚Äôs a common problem! 2. The bathrooms were not that nice, the bathtub wasn‚Äôt even clean (not that we were gonna use it!) but the bathrooms just felt really archaic, the quality, shower pressure etc. <br/>The pool was still very nice and up to our expectations. Yogi was very helpful!,Nice villa, but the entrance is through a narrow lane, which smells.  Not enough pots and pans. Living and kitchen is open with no door or slider, and we had an incident at night where the food on the table was a bit messy when we woke up as if some animal entered the kitchen since there are no doors. But overall, I loved the place.,good place to stay!,Overall, it‚Äôs a good place to stay, just the door for each room was a bit hard to pull.,Comfortable space and helpful hosts,Pleasant stay in this spacious villa, with a large pool.<br/>Villa with 3 large bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms.<br/>the bathrooms are a little dated. It's still very good for Bali, especially with value for money.<br/>Thanks Yogi,This villa is at secluded alley in a busy main road in Kerobokan Raya. You can park the car and motorcycle inside the alley although there's not much space. <br/>but the Villa itself are very spacious and tranquil. the pool is large and so does the room. the common area (kitchen and living room) are so big as well. each room has sets of room key and main entrance key, which makes it easy if you have separate plan within your group.<br/>check in and check out are a breeze even when we arrive very late and check out very early. <br/>you need hair dryer? just text Yogi, he'll send right away. the villa was cleaned every other day.,everything perfect.,Lovely place to stay in with family and friends, we spent a good 3 nights in the villa.,This villa was good value for money. The pool is very nice and clean, and the villa is in a convenient location. The bathrooms are a bit dated and not the cleanest, with some minor fixes needed. The water pressure for showers was low. However, for the price, this place was good value.,Yogi's villa was an absolute delight! As a host, Yogi was attentive and made sure everything was perfect for my stay. The villa itself was stunning and well-maintained, creating a truly enjoyable experience.

Our weekend at the villa went super cool. Kadek was always polite and helped us with any request. The villa was always tidy and clean. We spent a lot of time by the pool and relaxed in the warm and clear water. the rooms were always cold, despite the fact that it was hot outside (apparently the air conditioners were powerful). Our children often lay on the sofa and were happy to watch cartoons on large TVs, and my wife happily cooked for us in the kitchen, but the knives needed to be sharpened ;) And despite the fact that the villa is located in an area close to restaurants and shops, it was always quiet. This is not our first holiday in Bali and we were very pleased with the choice of a villa this time. We'll definitely come back again,Nice villa in a wonderful location. It is in this villa that children are constantly in the pool. It is well located, always clean. <br/>Special thanks to Kadek. We flew in on March 11 at night and did not work in Bali. He bought us groceries in advance so that on the day of silence we were not left without food. <br/>Thank you for your hospitality.,We were extremely disappointed with the state of the villa, it is very unkempt, hasn‚Äôt been maintained well, lacks essential amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, kitchen items. Didn‚Äôt even have umbrellas for guests to utilise. Both TV‚Äôs in bedrooms had flat batteries, bathrooms were dirty and we were only given one roll of toilet paper (had to request more). There was only one very small safe to share between  two rooms, which was only accessible in the master bedroom via key (not personalised code) which poses the question if it was deemed safe as we had no assurance that there wasn‚Äôt a second key anywhere. This also meant that the couple we stayed with didn‚Äôt have access to their items in the safe unless we were at the villa to open it for them. <br/>The pool hadn‚Äôt been cleaned and the lawn wasn‚Äôt maintained. The air conditioners didn‚Äôt work to full capacity and there were no fans in the bedrooms. <br/>Doesn‚Äôt look anything like what is shown in the pictures. <br/>We booked this villa aft,Kitchen needs more equipment like kettle ect but otherwise it‚Äôs a nice villa for the price and in a good central location and the staff are super friendly and helpful üôè I would stay there again it‚Äôs nice and private,Beautiful property in the heart of Seminyak.

Waled assisted us in an early check in and was able to arrange transport to the villa. <br/>Security and staff are around the grounds of the villa complex almost all hours which makes it feel like a very safe stay. <br/>The villa is able to be cleaned daily including pool cleaning which was also really great. <br/>While there is a lot to do in walking distance we found it easier to hire a bike to get to places such as eat street and the area of Seminyak Square. Gojeks were also easy to get from outside on the main road and only $1-2 to get to the busy areas of Seminyak. <br/>I would definitely stay at this villa again,Beautiful Villa in a perfect location.

Erica's delicious spring rolls added a delightful touch to our stay. <br/>Robert's plethora of suggestions for day outings enhanced our trip, and he even connected us with a fantastic tour guide who took us on a memorable day trip to Ubud. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. <br/>Thank you, Erica and Robert, for your exceptional hospitality!,A perfect place!!! <br/>Quiet, clean, good internet, with everything you need to feel at home (very well equipped). <br/>I stayed 10 days and it was very pleasant.

This place offers various accommodations, each with its unique charm, and I intend to try them all!<br/>Strategically speaking, this is the most comfortable accommodation I've booked in Bali so far.

What sets this place  apart is its exceptional qualities:<br/>- Fast internet<br/>- Impeccable cleanliness<br/>- Exceptionally helpful staff, including the wonderful owners, Erica and Robert<br/>- Serene and quiet surroundings<br/>- A tranquil and relaxed atmosphere<br/>- A tropical paradise with a lush mango garden and numerous fruit trees<br/>- Surprising amenities that go beyond typical Airbnb accommodations<br/>For a first-time visitor to Bali like myself, I believe there's no better place on the entire island. Everything here, from the staff to the management, is perfectly organized. I wholeheartedly rate it 10/10 stars.,Erica and Robert's accommodation is centrally located in Kuta/Legian.<br/>15 minutes walk to Kuta Beach<br/>Very fast internet with my 2 connected vpn's I could still achieve up to 150mbit down and 120 mbit upload which is rare my expectations were 30/40 Mbit.

However, a warning to future guests - please check that the battery cover inside the safe door is on if you are storing things in the safe. Someone had removed the cover, so when they banged on the safe the batteries fell out and it was able to be opened. We had a sum of money stolen from the safe, which was never refunded. The owner was quite difficult to deal with over the phone - initially didn't believe that this had occurred, and once we were very firm, said she wouldn't do anything unless we went to the police. <br/>Other than this we had a lovely stay.,My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Ambermoon Villas. Everything was taken care of for us including airport transfers and scooter hire, so we didn‚Äôt have to worry about anything. Nothing was a hassle and everyone we spoke with were more than happy to assist. I even broke my shoes one night and one of the gentleman offered me his own shoes to walk the short distance back to our room!!!? Amazing!! üò≠<br/>The villa itself was beautiful! Clean, modern. It had everything we needed! Our own private oasis away from the hustle and bustle of busy Seminyak, but still close to everything!!

Three excellent outdoor areas. Plenty of sun and shade. Interior exactly like photos - two excellent main en-suite bathrooms - perfect for two couples.  Excellent aircon with fully enclosed living area that opens out to pool.  Service good without being excellent.  Was impossible to find villa as the directions given and on AirBNB listing, are wrong!  Also their phone number listed in AirBNB has been disconnected.    The villa is down a long alleyway with no signage on the street. Unfortunately this meant an extra hour driving around trying to find the villa.,Great location. Great staffing. Newly constructed,We had a lovely stay. It‚Äôs a lovely villa. Thank you.<br/>However, there was a misunderstanding with the host booking us a private driver for our checkout which was taken out of our deposit without our consent. <br/>We had already booked our own driver a few days before our stay and Yati refused to accept that. <br/>We asked for the 400,000 IDR to be returned  to which they refused to return our money. <br/>As a result we felt obliged not to argue and just let them keep the 400,000 IDR which was a shame.,Thank you to Yati and her team, they were extremely professional and we enjoyed every minute of our stay.

We were able to coordinate meals, tours, and spa treatments all through the devoted staff. The villa is walking distance to many shops and restaurants and close enough to nearby areas for day trips. I don‚Äôt think our experience would have been as great without the staff and the wonderful stay in this villa! This was our first time in Bali so we spent quite a bit of time exploring but if you just wanted to relax, you would never need to leave the villa.

The kitchen/dining area was gorgeous and open planned so was great for the evenings! The host was super responsive and helpful and what we appreciated the most were the wonderful team and cleaners who would come in daily to make the place back to perfection! I would really recommend this property, as we were only a couple of minutes on bike from the centre of canguu, and so the location was also excellent! <br/>The only thing i would mention which i completely appreciate is out of the hosts control is the overwhelming amount of flies that end up on the ceilings in the living area. Although this did not affect our stay, it‚Äôs definitely worth looking into as the amount of them was strange.,Our stay at Villa Noumea in Canggu from June 14-19, 2024, was okay. There was a persistent sewage smell throughout our stay, which was quite disturbing.<br/>The overall cleaning was okay but superficial, only covering visible areas. When searching for a missing key under the bed, I found a thick layer of dust that seemed to have accumulated for a long time. On the positive side, the Netflix setup was fun, and all rooms were a decent size. The villa is also in a great location, and the door is passcode protected, so you don‚Äôt need to carry keys with you, which was very convenient.<br/>Despite these cleaning and smell issues, we did find some enjoyment in the villa.,Great!,Great villa with lots of amazing amenities - everything you could ask for was there.

The villa is beautifully designed, spacious and in a great location. Most places in Seminyak are walking distance. Also the beds are soooo comfortable.<br/>The only downside of the villa is that 2 rooms (4 people) have to share a bath room and the toilet is not separate. Also the light switch for the bath room is in one of the bed rooms. Not very convenient.<br/>Communication on Airbnb was slow and the refund for the missing extra bed (that we luckily didn't need anymore) took a long time and some effort.,Great location, big size villa and huge size bedroom. But mostly a little bit trouble to find the staff except we call first from the room.but overall nice place to stay.,Great experience in Origin Seminyak. <br/>Amazing pool! Location is near to any places in Seminyak. Easy access and enough space for parking lot.<br/>The staffs are very helpfull, fast response and they cleaned our rooms everyday. <br/>Definitely will come back again.<br/>Thanks Origin!,The villa is nice, clean & very comfortable. The location of the villa is very strategic even though it is a little inside the alley Our family is happy to stay here. The swimming pool is within1.8mtr-2.5mtr children can only swim at the edge of the pool stairs. There is a small lack of noise from the neighbors & lack of privacy because the neighbors can see into our villa area. But overall the villa is very comfortable. Highly recommend staying here.<br/>Will stay here again on my next trip,The village is huge, the pool is also very spacious. The pool is quite deep, so it is not recommended for small children. Clean room, cool air conditioning. Amenities are also complete. Shower is tight, but to get hot, it takes a bit of time. <br/>The location is in the alley, but some parking is available. If the villa is rame, the parking lot can be full. <br/>At the time of my stay, the power arrived at a time when no one was. However, the staff who take care directly helps. <br/>Overall I like the villa even though there are small things that are a bit disturbing, but it's not a problem. I will definitely come back to this villa!!! <br/>Thankyou Origin,Big pool , clean , god job for staff üëèü•∞ 2 week feel at home ‚ù§ thx ari , dkk üôè,Nice place to stay, strategic location",2,-8.683040046,115.1564676,8,FALSE,"Entire villa,5 beds,4 baths","Check-in after 2:00 PM,Checkout before 12:00 PM,8 guests maximum","Self check-in,value:You can check in with the building staff.,Dive right in,value:This is one of the few places in the area with a pool.",4BR Stylish Seminyak Beachside Pool Villa,30506,France

The location was central, 1km from the beach, with a good choice of restaurants close by. We lost our key to the room at the beach and Maudy was helpful and quick to respond to our call for ‚Äòhelp‚Äô!,Maudy‚Äôs place was perfect for me. Kuta is a more residential area so it is quieter that other places in Bali but close to everything with Grab. The room was very clean and has everything needed, including a pot to warm up or prepare basic food, dishes and utensils. The balcony is great to relax in the evening. Everyone working in the hotel was friendly and Maudy was super responsive. The wifi was fine for my needs but you can always upgrade. I didnt use the pool much but it was always clean and well maintained. I will definitely go back to Maudy‚Äôs place if it is available.,Great place to stay, close to everything and very friendly,Great place,From the beginning, Maudy has always been responsive and answered all my queries promptly.

The facilities in the hotel and residence are well kept. I'll definitely choose this place if I'm back in Bali.,Good location, the place is cozy, and without a doubt, the attention from Maudy from start to finish was the best. Thank you for everything!!,Great place, would definitely stay again! No complaints at all! The floor creaked a little bit but that is extremely minor. Absolutely great value as well! The unit is clean and modern, and the balcony was nice to watch the sunset from. <br/>Maudy was easy to communicate with, and the building staff was also very helpful. It is not necessarily a central location but is very convenient for things Kuta and Seminyak side, and there's plenty of food within walking distance. Also less than 20 minutes from the Airport!<br/>Great stay!,A great and comfortable stay. Maudy was really responsive and the location was prime.

The pool was super nice and although this place is separate from the hotel, the hotel staff were really friendly and helpful.,Had the best experience in this studio. Spent a month and has already booked it for a few more months in Summer. The apartment is super clean, has no bugs no weird smells, the shower works perfectly. The condo has three pools lit with sun so the water is nice and warm. The area is not very touristy, so you'd have to take a 10 minutes bike ride to get to the beach or to the crowded tourist streets with bars and nightclubs if that's your thing. There are several very nice and stylish caf√©s just in a few minutes walk distance with WiFi and electric plugs that I really enjoyed working from.,Very nice and helpful owner, we had problems with electricity and she moved us to another room for free. Very good and big room with beautiful views from 2 windows.,My husband and I stayed with Maudie for four weeks. Check in and check out with the code, we ended up not even meeting the hostess. But at the same time, welcome treats were waiting for us, it was a very pleasant thing!<br/>The room has everything you need, tableware, fridge, air conditioning, insect repellent, hairdryer, iron, iron, kettle and even a steamer. The housekeeper and change of bed, towels took place weekly.<br/>The internet is stable and it was important to us as we are working online. There were no issues with video calls. <br/>Neighbors can't be heard, so is the noise coming from the street.<br/>The only thing is that the shower is not the most comfortable damper and the water sometimes floods the area with a sink and toilet. But there was always hot water and good water pressure.<br/>Thank you Moudy! :),A cozy apartment; value for money! Excellent host :),Maudi is always available for any questions.<br/>The photo is completely true, good cleaning once a week, change linen and towels, also add drinking water, which is especially nice.<br/>In the room there is a rice cooker and a steamer and some dishes, you can cook some food.<br/>I recommend, I liked everything,Good place,This is a great place for remote workers in Kuta.

The services were excellent. The location is great, walkable to the beach, not too far from all the fun places in seminyak but at the same time the villa is very quiet and private. We hope we could stay longer here. We had such a lovely time ‚ù§Ô∏è,The villa was amazing, it had all the benefits of a private villa with all the help  of a hotel. The staff were lovely, so friendly and came in every day to serve breakfast, to clean and to spray for mosquitoes in the evening. It‚Äôs walkable to shops, bars, restaurants and the beach. It feels very safe and very private as there are only 3 villas. Putu, the manager was very responsive and helpful, she organised airport transfer and a day trip to the Safari. We had two young children so cot with mosquito net and high chair were also provided. Would definitely recommend!! Thank you!!!<br/>Only thing to note is we had assumed breakfast was included but it is additional. But only about ¬£5 per person so very reasonable and very good!!,Amazing stay at Chimera Villa, we were 4 people and absolutely enjoyed the privacy of the pool. The villa's layout is very welcoming, with sufficient space at living and dining area that is connected to the kitchen. Direct access to the pool from the living room. Greatly appreciate the help, I was supported by Putu during my stay. She was very responsive to any of our requests.,Second time I‚Äôve stayed at Chimera Villas and it will always be one of my favorite places to stay in Seminyak.,Amazing stay at chimera villa. the villa is better in person then what you see in photos. all cooking facilities, filtered water provided. Amazing staff and security that helped us with locations to see and transport. Location is less than a 4 min walk from seminyak square and less than 1 min walk from great coffee store and 24 hour supermarket (circle k) Our flight was delayed and host was even able to assist with a late checkout. Will always stay here when I am in Bali.,Excellent place.  Would recommend to anyone,Chimera is a beautiful place to stay with easy access to restaurants and shops nearby. The staff is wonderful and helped to arrange food service, massage and laundry which is just what I was looking for, to have an easy and relaxing experience. The pool is lovely and the property is private. I would recommend and stay again.,We spend 9 nights with our friends in this villa and it was amazing. The team helped us with every questions (scooter rental, airport transfer, etc.) and the daily breakfeast was delicious. Thanks to the whole team for making our stay perfect like this.,This is a brilliant villa. We stayed with our friends and babies. The staff were incredibly attentive and helpful, they made a fuss of our babies and helped to tidy away toys etc. Everything ran smoothly, it felt like having the best bits of a hotel (turn down service, breakfast, maids to do washing, cleaning etc) mixed with the privacy of a villa. It is in a superb location, 10 mins walk in one direction leads to the main eating street and 10 mins in the opposite direction leads to the beach. All easily accessible with strollers, although the roads around the villa are narrow so you just need to be careful. We had a fantastic stay and would recommend this villa to our friends and family.,My travelling partner and I had a 20 day/night stay in this villa. The host (Eka) and all of her staff were both attentive and welcoming throughout the whole period. Communication prior to arrival was good and despite a small hiccup, the transfer from the airport was extremely helpful to get our holiday under way.<br/>The villa itself was absolutely awesome. Comfortable, spacious, but more importantly rather snug, with front door access off a private yard from a small alley way basically 2 streets behind the Seminyak shopping strip. It was only a few minutes walk to the various supermarkets, pharmacy's, currency exchanges, bars, cafes and restaurants. The beach was also within short walking distance. To be honest, it was rather impressive.<br/>The gardens were very neat, tidy and well looked after, plus the huge pool was simply fantastic! The air-conditioning units in both bedrooms functioned well and were a welcome retreat from the humidity outside. Unfortunately, there were a few minor issues with some of the fixings such as no external lock on the master bedroom, and a faulty shower-head in the second, but nothing really that couldn't be worked around.<br/>There was also a security detail on-hand 24 hours a day, if needed. The only thing that significantly impacted our time there was some impromptu construction/remodelling to one of the adjoining villas during our last week, and 3 or 4 occasions where a drone was spotted hovering in our backyard for quite sometime. This in itself was an invasion of privacy, but still.<br/>Prior notice about the work being undertaken would have been nice considering the price that we paid for a quiet, relaxing stay. Having said all of that though, the staff were more than accommodating to our needs over the 3 week period. This included arrangements of special dinners, alcohol supply, organisation of drivers, as well as particular deliveries directly to the villa door.<br/>Out of all our trips to Bali over the past few years, this accommodation would have to be the best one we've stayed in yet. Personally, I highly recommend Chimera Villas to anyone looking for a luxurious get-away. To all the crew, keep up the great work, and thank you for the memories!,We spent a week at this villa and were very happy for our entire stay. The rooms are decorated to a high standard and very comfortable with modern amenities. The gardens are well maintained and we especially enjoyed relaxing in and around the swimming pool. <br/>The location is in a quiet lane and is convenient to walk to the local attractions - restaurants, shops, beach all within 5 minutes. <br/>Best of all were our hosts. They are all super efficient, very welcoming and took great care of us. They kept the villa very clean and tidy, being on hand as needed and serving some excellent meals.  We particularly enjoyed a lovely continental breakfast every morning, served in the villa dining room, which set us up well for the day. <br/>We wish we had more time to stay longer.]",4.5,-8.68754,115.15787,4,FALSE,"Entire villa,4 beds,3.5 bathrooms","Check-in after 3:00 pm,Checkout before 12:00 pm,4 guests maximum","Dedicated workspace,value:A common area with wifi that‚Äôs well suited for working.,Self check-in,value:You can check in with the building staff.,Great location,value:100% of recent guests gave the location a 5-star rating.",2BR Luxury Green Villa Seminyak,11967,Paris

Wish there would have been more flexibility in regards to our check in + I sustained an injury and continued sleeping in blood covered sheets when the housekeeper definitely must have seen the stains when cleaning.,Good location, easy to get around, close to good restaurants and shopping. Villa was tidy and private around the pool.,Great central location to many restaurants! It is off the main road, so you don‚Äôt hear much of traffic. Would book again!,Enjoyable stay. A very nice little villa in central Seminyak. Would stay again!,This villa is in the perfect location. It's down a quiet alley but only a short walk to Sisterfields which was our go-to coffee in the morning. Nice pool & comfy bed. The TVs with Netflix were so great too.,First day on arrival pool had maintenance issues was unable to use it for the first few hours. Both AC units were leaking water most of our clothes got wet in our luggage. Had to wait 2 hours for the water to go back on as it got cut out was un able to shower.<br/>Over all aesthetically looks good overall not practical.,I visited as solo female traveler and felt super safe. Location is perfect, amazing with a private pool.<br/>Arke was fantastic with the pick up and helped with whatever I had a need for and also helped drive me to my next location.<br/>Would recommend and there is a lot to do near Seminyak, so would even recommend staying there in more than 3 nights.,Loved it, highly recommend. I will stay here again,Amazing place to stay! Absolutely recommend staying here when in bali!,Our stay at Villa Rapa was simply delightful! This cozy villa is conveniently located just footsteps away from the bustling town of Seminyak, yet it manages to provide a haven of privacy and tranquility. The beautiful pool, well-maintained Villa with all the amenities you could need (towels, silverware, fridge, microwave, AC, etc.), made it the perfect place to relax and unwind after our exciting excursions in Ubud. Villa looks exactly like the photos!<br/>Arke, the on-site Villa manager, was a true gem - always helpful and easy to communicate with. The Airbnb hosts were also incredibly accommodating, allowing us a late check-out to make the most of our time and pre arranged transportation to the airport with Arke. <br/>What we loved most was the villa's walkable proximity to all the restaurants and shops, making it incredibly convenient. Villa Rapa provided the ideal blend of convenience and privacy, and we can't wait to come back!,Had a wonderful stay. Great place with all the facilities you need in easy walking distance to the beach, cafes, restaurants, shops and more. Only a few minutes walk to the action but quiet, no road or other noise to worry about. Fast Internet for work or streaming on the two large TV's. The pool is a good size and gets the right amount of sun and shade to be the perfect temperature to cool off.

Price includes breakfast 2 people","Our stay at Uma Pantai has been blissful. It is a lovely hotel right opposite the black sand beach. You can expect to have breakfast by the beach at Warung Pantai, which is also lovely. There are lots of wild, well-behaved dogs roaming around the beach and the cafe. <br/>will love to comeback again next time <br/>The only minor problem to keep in mind is that the hotel is located in a small, secluded area, so the road will be quite tight for bigger cars,We were very satisfied with the stay. Right on the beach, their beachfront venues are spectacular. The room was sufficient. Breakfast was very good, unlimited. It's just a little difficult to find the hotel on the first day, even taxi drivers are struggling to find the road is very narrow.,Good value for money! Chill spot, just a quick drive outside Canggu,We worried that it seemed so out of the way but in the light of day it was an excellent location.  No hawkers just relaxed chilled area.  Especially having the Warung here.  Bed super comfy and good wifi and showers.  Value for money.,Amazing place we were here for 2 days <br/>And I would say the place is amazing <br/>The service is too notch <br/>Specially the waves sound at night while sleeping his so soothing <br/>Truly wonderful experience,One of the most beautiful listing in Bali,Amazing, will definitely stay here again.,The beach is just a stone's throw away, a coastal cafe with a good menu and delicious food. As for me, it's a little far from the main places, but it's generally acceptable. Noise insulation is lame, you literally hear conversations and everything that happens in neighboring rooms. Overall, it's good place: comfortable, quiet and secluded.,Super accommodation friendly and helpful staff. Everything you need in the vicinity. However, you should be careful when paying because the staff sometimes confuses the table but otherwise top. Daily room cleaning+fresh towels and water. Motor scooter can also be rented directly on site for a small amount of money. Can only recommend the accommodation will be happy to come back. Thanks so much for the nice days.,Hello,<br/>Very nice location, by the sea with all the rooms overlooking the sea!<br/>The staff is super welcoming, and helped us get to the apartments.<br/>The big difficulty is access. No road to get there and drive the suitcase in the stoned paths was not easy.<br/>Work is underway but I don't think it's finished for a short year.<br/>Otherwise for the beach bar, the access is not nonsense. It's a shame the bar is very good. But you have to pass by the doors of the kitchen and stock and there are some trash that hangs out.<br/>Access to review to avoid passage in the middle of the areas dedicated to staff,<br/>I give this review for improvement! Frankly, it was very good. üëç,One of the best airbnb ever !!! <br/>In love with this place !! This little paradise will start to be rare in Bali soon. Isolate and adorable place !

The breakfast on the beach was a nice touch . Great value. Staff are lovely. We will be back!,Had a fantastic stay at Uma Pantai Seseh. Gorgeous place, really relaxing. Breakfast was yummy. Loved the Warung attached - watched sunset there with food also.<br/>The staff were all lovely & friendly. Very welcoming. <br/>The pool was green upon arrival, but on my second day they emptied & refilled it which I was happy about üòÅ really nice.<br/>Gorgeous view from all rooms.

Such a lovely place!,Truly a hidden gem for anyone wanting a more quiet beach view experience.

Incredible spot,This stay is the best stay of my bali trip. Feel like home. Very near to market and most lovely property to stay. Must book atleast for two nights,Great stay!,frankly, one of the best places in terms of cleanliness and location, actually we were caught in it, and I sat there for two days and I wanted to extend but unfortunately what was available, I strongly advise them üëçüèº,The place is cozy and very traditional. Just lack of lighting in the upper room but it's very enough for a holiday with family and close to the crowds. So just walk if you want to shop or eat.,The villa was amazing, we loved staying here and it is comfortable! The only downfall for us, was that it was very noisy with the surrounding traffic, music etc. <br/>We would highly recommend!,Overall, the villa served the purpose of our trip. It was our first time in Bali so I didn't know what to expect. The villa was great and the swimming area was really relaxing. It is in a busy part of Semenyak, so you definitely hear all vehicle noises and people talking. The villa is very private though so you don't feel exposed to the street noise. The hosts were very responsive and answered our questions quickly. Overall a good experience.,Good service and helpful staff and very humble<br/>Thank you Risa and Made üòò,The place was beautiful just like the photos! We loved all the cool authentic decorations of the home! The outdoor showers and big tub helped us to relax as well. The plants are well maintained and we loved the floating breakfast and massage sessions we arranged with the host's help. He also provided 108 Yoga as a local recommendation. The only negative is that it can be noisy at times with the motorcycles and a dance club playing music loudy every night. I wore earplugs and had the air conditioning running to help block some noise. Overall it was a great time!,Merci Villa is something you wouldn't expect to find in the heart of a Busy Seminyak. <br/>It's lush green with a beautiful blue pool and two bedrooms rooms which provide direct access to the pool. But the third bedroom which is upstairs is a treat in its own offering complete privacy with romantic vibes. <br/>You can order everything easily inside the villa via Grab or the nearby Warung Kecil and they deliver inside the villa.

Other hotspots like Seminyak beach, Kuta, Legian, Finns are all within 20-30 mins by cab. <br/>Overall this villa gave us an excellent start for our trip and made us feel right at home.<br/>Special thanks to Made and another helpful staff member whose name I can't recall for making the villa clean for us everyday!<br/>Would like to visit again if I come to Bali!,Good experience!!!,We stayed in this magnificent villa for 4 days with our group of friends, it is a really stylish, clean villa, the co-hosts constantly checked if we needed anything. The villa is cleaned daily. I recommend a really magnificent villa to all guests,Luxury Villas Merci Report is a fantastic place to stay, if you want to stay in Seminyak. On the first night of our stay, by a freak coincidence the kitchen bench broke. We were left perplexed and weren‚Äôt sure if we could continue to stay at the villa due to essential repairs, however, Komang was very calm and friendly about the situation. He wanted to repair the broken bench ASAP without us having to leave. He worked around our schedule and was extremely flexible. Kormang and I went halves in the repairs and his communication throughout our entire stay was second to none. A great villa, with fantastic management!,Transportation is very convenient, but it is too noisy at night. The sound of the roadside motorcycle and the sound of the bar singing can't sleep well. Families with children are not recommended.But if you come with friends or couples, it's still a good choice.,bbl,Fantastic Luxury villa. Super beautiful.

It would be better they should talk nicely rather then throwing stuff straight to our villa .everyone is safe but we were lucky the pieces of a broken glass just missed hitting us by a foot or two however the cup almost hit me in the head while i was in the pool however we are not getting any confidence from the owners side they took it lightly and said we complained to the police but its not about not getting hit its about the vibe that we have lost about our holiday in bali we planned some activities and missed them because we just stood awake in one room till sunrise. Host of this villa took this thing too normally. He was not helpful. We booked for 2 days but i left the villa other day because of safety-concerns of me and my friends.

From the moment, we were picked up from the airport we knew we had found the best stay for us and our two toddlers. We stayed at Sunshine and had the pool fence, pram and cot ready for us. Nina was an absolute dream, she cooked, cleaned and took care of our kids. They absolutely adored her and our two year old is still calling out for \Nee-Na\ back home. Nina, Wayan and the Saudara team went above and beyond for us and we couldn't have asked for anything more. We are already planning our next stay for next year.,We had such an amazing stay at the villa, the location is extremely convenient and easy walking distance to lots of great places to eat and shop, yet the villa itself is so peaceful, we loved having our private pool to relax in and escape the hustle and bustle when we were needing a break. The furnishings and amenities were all great quality, beds were super comfy and the air con was much appreciated!<br/>However the most special part was definitely the amazing hospitality displayed by the staff - thank you Wayan, Joe & of course the wonderful Nina! With all your combined efforts every aspect of our stay was a breeze, from transport to assistance with booking day trips, to Nina even arranging a cake for my mums birthday and helping to make her day extra special. We will miss you and hope to be back one day soon!,Our stay at Villa Saudara was absolutely magic. Nina and wayan couldn‚Äôt have been more incredible hosts. The place was spotless, food was on point and the location is fantastic. Would recommend to others. What a great holiday we had!,This place is wonderful, the pool, the setting, the beautiful bathroom and the comfy beds. The most beautiful part for me though was the staff, they are so warm and kind. Thank you Nina for all your delicious food and for out sorting everything. Wayan for being so accommodating and Jo for your patience and always being ready with a laugh and a smile.<br/>Thank you üôè,Amazing villa. So tranquil and yet so close to everything. Spotlessly clean and comfortable.<br/>You will not regret staying here.,This little cozy villa was perfect. We booked last minute and and they responded very fast and we even got to check in earlier. It was a family trip and my mom fell in love with the villa. We were greeted with cute pineapple juice and cold towel.  Wayan and Nina‚Äôs hospitality was delightful. Always greeting us with smile and always fast to respond to the messages. They had plate full of fruits prepared for us. The fridge was stocked with drinks and snacks. We did have issues with shower drain clogging and water flowing into one of the bedroom and also kitchen floor leaking, but they came to take care of it. Location was close to everything and lively, but villa was quiet since it was in an alley. We would definitely stay here again.,It would have been better if the pool water was a little cleaner, and so was the bathtub. Other than that, the kindness and the beautifulness of the accommodation were so good, and Linna, who helped me with the guidance, was so kind.,Spent a five night stay at the villa and it truly felt like home.  We were made to feel welcome and Wayan and the team took care of everything we needed.  They were anticipating our requests so that is a great level of service.<br/>The villa suited our family and the kids loved the pool, they even had a swim vest for our four year old, which made us feel more comfortable.<br/>The location is great, walking distance to so much.<br/>Would definitely return.,Absolutely loved our stay here!! The location was amazing, Wayan and Anita were gems!! They went above and beyond for us and made our stay great. <br/>Thank you!,Words don‚Äôt do justice just how amazing our Bali holiday was and all because of this beautiful villa and the amazing people. <br/>The villa itself is gorgeous, and the air conditioned lounge was perfect after a hot walk into town. The location is perfect; walking distance to local markets and the beach, but is somehow so quiet and peaceful. This place is an absolute oasis in the middle of Seminyak. <br/>The best part of the villa however was Nina; who made our stay. Nina was an absolute delight to see every day and was so wonderful with our 8 month old daughter. <br/>We couldn‚Äôt recommend this villa enough, especially for families with little kids! Thanks so much Nina, Wayan and Jojo for ja wonderful holiday.,We had the most amazing stay in Villa Sunshine. The butler, Nina was the most generous and beautiful human and who no ask was too much. The check in with Wayan was so friendly and we felt right at home. The villa is spotless day and night and the pool was just the right size. <br/>This was our first holiday in five years, the first as a family, and it could not have been better. <br/>I feel so relaxed despite having a 2 year old and this is all thanks to Nina and Wayan and the whole team who keep Villa Sunshine going.,We really loved our stay in this villa. A quiet peaceful location, but so close to everything at the same time. Everything you need is within a very short walk, from the beach, coffee shops, truly great restaurants and great night life as well. We particularly liked the ability to close off the living space and switch on the aircon as it was pretty hot during our stay, so after a hot walk around the area it was great to come back to your own clear cool and sparkly pool and air conditioned space to lounge around with a refreshing beverage (and/or a quiet nap) before heading out again in the evening. Wayan and the staff at the villa were also amazing, so friendly and helpful and really catered to our every need. All in all a great place to stay and we would highly recommend.,Our stay at Anna‚Äôs Airbnb was lovely, we had Nina organise breakfast & lunch inside the villa a few days out of our stay and it was amazing. The Airbnb is clean and has everything you need, the filtered drinking water is super handy. A plus is having revolver at the end of the street for delicious coffee and eats as well. Overall our stay was fabulous,The Villa was just as advertised.  Very quiet but only a few mins walk to eat street (quieter end) so was perfect to just walk with the kids instead of getting stuck in any traffic.  Anna was extremely helpful with any questions I had and responded so quickly! <br/>Nina was always so friendly and was a great addition, she was great with our kids too when we needed someone to look after them for shorter periods of time! Would recommend staying her and would stay again üòä,We had a lovely stay at the villa! Communication went very well and Nina was fantastic! The kids are talking about her or always talking about her. They also enjoyed the pool very much.<br/>The location of the villa is very pleasant: it is quiet around the villa, but you also walk into the coziness.,Great location. Very much as described. Nina and Wayan were both great, as were the drivers they arranged for us. Really central location but quiet and removed from the business.,We had a great stay at the villa! The kids loved the pool and the in-house breakfast!,Great host and staff. Very helpful and friendly. Made us feel at home,We stayed at Anna‚Äôs lovely villa for a week and enjoyed every moment. So close to restaurants, shops and amenities which was great. The villa was spotlessly clean and well equipped with generously sized bedrooms and bathrooms. We didn‚Äôt use the kitchen very much but it was great to have a full sized fridge and we loved the snacks and drinks at supermarket prices!  The pool area was super clean and we loved relaxing both in and around it. Finally, Nina was amazing! She was super helpful, made us some lovely meals and was on hand whenever we needed. Thank you Nina for making our stay so wonderful,Great place for being in the center of everything in Seminyak. Master bedroom bathroom had a weird smell the entire stay. That is the only reason I‚Äôm giving 4 stars, my wife didn‚Äôt enjoy that. BUT! Great location! In the center of everything!,Wonderful hospitality. Wayan and Nina were great. Always there to help out with our needs and queries. Nina was very proactive in giving a helping hand with the kids. Pool size was great and clean. Floating breakfast was awesome. Location is great albeit a roughly 80m walk from the villa to the main road. Overall we had a great stay. Would recommend this place! Thanks Anna and team!,Wayan and Anna and are excellent in their communication.  We had to book last minute and the two of them made accommodations right away.  <br/>The place is an oasis in the heart of seminyak.   <br/>We loved to just walk to revolver espresso, as well as a few of the other restaurants. Considering the traffic in the area, this is truly a blessing.<br/>We really appreciate wayan and Anna having us and hopefully one day stay again.,Excellent location, still quiet and cozy. Great for families and Nina the housekeeper was absolutely fantastic ‚ù§Ô∏è,All the staff were very welcoming and pleasant, especially Nina who was very attentive to us and we thank her for that]",3,-8.6858,115.1576,4,FALSE,"Entire villa,2 beds,2 baths","Check-in after 3:00 PM,Checkout before 12:00 PM,4 guests maximum","Top 10% of homes,value:This home is highly ranked based on ratings, reviews, and reliability.,Dedicated workspace,value:A room with wifi that‚Äôs well-suited for working.,Self check-in,value:You can check in with the building staff.",Villa with closed aircon lounge/ 400m to the Beach,47477,Netherlands

The shower booth was a sunflower type, so it was rusty. The sink faucet was also a little rusty, so the water only came out in one direction. <br/>The road is a little cramped for a car to pass by, but it wasn't a difficult location to find, so it was no problem.<br/>Overall, I was very satisfied with the value for the money.,I would recommend this place , a very kind host, and good advice.,The place looks just as beautiful as the photos.

Overall was a great stay.,Pros: Looks like it is shown in the listing, spacious.<br/>Cons: The pool is the most disappointing part. It‚Äôs greenish and kind of dirty with lots of leaves (understandable as it is surrounded by many plants). The pool side sofa was also very dirty. The listing shows it was newly opened in 2022, but the maintenance says otherwise. The villa seems not properly maintained despite just 2-3 years of operation. We also noticed someone entering our villa when we were not around. We are not sure if it was the owner or the cleaner, but we found it quite insecure to not be informed.,Good villa,Amazing property and host.. must visit,Loved this Villa, it‚Äôs a bit out of town and we struggled getting grabs/taxi sometimes but otherwise loved the place!

The best so far!,Amazing stay, loved the theme and rooms and the pool. There was also drinking water provided. Water pressure was good and there was warm water. Air conditioning was strong too - very important during the hot day! WiFi worked well too - with 6 of us doing work there. It‚Äôs a little farther away from the rest of canggu so trips into town need around 20 mins by bike but that‚Äôs the trade off for a more peaceful location away from the crowds. Would consider booking again for a peaceful retreat.,It was a very quiet and comfortable vila.,One of the best villas we‚Äôve experienced in Bali after staying at many others.<br/>Definitely recommend staying here with friends or family.<br/>We enjoyed our stay and will definitely revisit again.

The night when we got there before I check in I told her I wanted to do a Flower Pool and she told me to give her in the morning. She‚Äôll check to find someone to do it for me and let me know. She waited till I was checking and knew that I couldn‚Äôt get a refund and then told me the next morning that it‚Äôs not allowed there. They were a dog that lived there and would not leave and stray cats were running all around when I said something to her about it. She told me that I should have read the reviews. we also had to contact them about the dog because the dog was in our village and would not leave. She then told us to give the dogs some food and put some food outside for the dog and the dog will leave. The villa is nice but I don‚Äôt recommend staying there I did not pay to stay with dogs.,Staff cleaning with no issues. Communication was seamless and efficient with active replies. No issues with the place.,Our stay at Villa Ganesha was peaceful and very enjoyable. Stayed with 6 people, each having a seperate bedroom with air conditioning and seperate shower and toilet spaces. The Villa had everything we needed and was a 10-15 minute Gojek ride in and out of beach clubs and bars. Any issues we had were resolved by jade, with regular cleaning of bedrooms and the pool, aswell as used appliances and dishes. It was stress free and was perfect for sitting in the sun and relaxing with friends. Be sure to check this place out üëçüëç,We had a great time at this beautiful Villa. <br/>A slice of heaven! <br/>Elvira is absolutely adorable, always available and very kind. <br/>I highly recommend this house, everything was perfect!,Best host in the world üåé,Great stay for 5 night with my friends, had everything we needed, very clean with great staff always around to help,Elvira was a nice host that took and the place looked like the pictures,Place was GREAT for six people. The open pool and living areas are great for enjoying time with everyone. The place was clean and looks exactly like the photos. Each bedroom was big with its own toilet and shower. The Villa manager was super responsive and helped whenever we needed. The Villa was cleaned every couple of days to standard. The location is not the greatest, it‚Äôs a 20/30 minutes drive by car to all the beach clubs and most popular restaurants, however, if you are not in a rush or do not intend on leaving the Villa much it is fine. Would definitely recommend this place to others wanting to stay in Bali.,Good place, has no problems,Amazing and great place to be in. Relaxing, and plenty of amenities available!

Elvira showed us every courtesy, from meeting us with a welcome beverage to organizing our check out times. There were six of us staying at the villa and we were all comfortable in our individual rooms. It was nice to have privacy yet have a shared swimming pool and living area. Although we did not choose to cook, the kitchen facilities and dining area were great for group cooking and eating. The location is not far from many activities if you wish to explore. It is easy to recommend Villa Ganesha for a group holiday.,We stayed in Villa Ganesha for 3 weeks for a remote working trip and we enjoyed our stay. <br/>Be aware that there is a dog, Polina/Paulina, living on the property. She is adorable but if your allergic or afraid you should look for a different villa. This villa is her home and she lives either right on the door step or under one of the tables. Don‚Äôt get me wrong she is lovely and harmless so no need to be scared. <br/>We paid 80‚Ç¨ for the night, which we all thought was good value for money. The villa is quite dated in some aspects. It was still lovely and we all had good nights sleep in the rooms. <br/>Canggu Beach was a little further away than ten minutes by scooter. It usually took 20 min by scooter and a little more by car. There is no beachfront access in this villa. <br/>The staff and house manager were always friendly and welcoming. We never felt uncomfortable when they came over. <br/>All in all, our stay in this villa was nice and we would recommend staying here.,This villa was just as expected with a pros and cons. Easy to get to the shops and laundry quiet location even though close to the main street. Mostly good communication lovely manager and all staff very polite. Be aware there is a dog (miss Pauline) who if you like dogs is great she lets you know when someone is coming down the street will sit to get food and will let you know when she wants to go out. We feel in love with her my daughter even got a bed made for her. Please be kind to her in your stay she is harmless. Would stay in this villa  again if we got the right price,Great host.,We stayed in villa Ganesha for one month. The stay at the villa was wort the price we paid as we had monthly discount that lowered the price a lot. The villa is quite far from the beach, in ussual traffic during the day it took 30 minutes ride by scooter. Furniture and equipment of villa is quite old but sufficient. Problems were with the birds that were residing on the roof of maybe every room and that caused every day mess like feathers and other uncleanlinesses. Positives were that outside living room is big and we had more possibilities where to sit, work and relax. The garden looks also nice. The stuff was friendly and helpful.,Very hospitable hosts. They always helped with all questions. WiFi is not always fast, but all the rest is great. I recommend it!,Beautiful place, sad to leave.<br/>Book without hesitation,The space is really big, comfortable, and clean.

Thanks Paula.,Great communication with the staff, but the pic-reality accuracy is 6.5/10. But overall, a very strategic place indeed.,I had a great stay here with my wife! 2 small things, first, the room is a little smaller than it seems from the photos (there were multiple rooms shown in the listing when I booked), secondly, the internet is a little slow if you are using it for work. For casual social media & streaming movies, there was no issue.

Saved us from using a lot of taxis. We walked to most of our lunches and dinners in Seminyak. Walkable distance to Ku De Ta as well. Ketut was a brilliant villa manager who listened to all our needs.,Fabulous Villa especially for a family with teens. Two living spaces and a large pool- only a small section was shallow before being extremely deep.,My family and I stayed 8 nights at Villa Raquel. The location is perfect if you want to be able to walk to shops and restaurants with kids. The villa staff are amazing and serviced the villa each day and answered any questions we had. The villa is 2 storey, the stair case isn‚Äôt ideal for young children. The rail is a bit wobbly and a small child could quite easily fit through the top rails if not watched at all times. <br/>The upstairs bedroom is lovely and bright with natural light but the 2 bedrooms downstairs are quite dark and gloomy and in need of an update. The downstairs bathroom could also do with some love. <br/>You need to make sure you put all your belongings away at night and food as stray cats came into the villa of an evening. <br/>Villa Raquels pool and garden were perfect for the kids and we had a lovely time out there during the day. <br/>All in all we had a nice stay, I just think the villa is due for some updates.,Clean, great location and very good communication,Great location. Wish the broken cooler was not there though but no big deal. <br/>The AC upstairs couldn‚Äôt be controlled either. Other than that, all good.,Quiet villa in group of villas with great pool and outdoor shower.<br/>Upstairs bedroom and living area very warm and upstairs bedroom - due to high tented ceiling I think - remained warm even with airconditioning on maximum 24/7 - however ground floor bedrooms X 2 cool. No issues for us with the stairs but may be an issue for elderly or small guests. Villa staff amazing .,the location was absolutely great, the garden was lovely. The villa is aging and would deserve renovation, but despite that we had a good time.,Excellent Villa! Would go back in a heartbeat!,Verry good,We had a pleasant stay at the villa. The place is well kept and clean. This villa have three large bedrooms which can easily cater for large family members. The place is conveniently located near to 24-hour marts. You can quickly reach the beach by taking grab or taxi. All in all we have no complains and everything was seamless through out our stay.,Lovely pool and garden. Perfect location for our 1st 3x nights in Bali. 5min walk to shops, 15min walk to beach. Staff were super friendly. Would definitely stay again! Thank you Ketut and team!,Bit run down but good location,The villa staff were all amazing, so friendly and helpful. We would look to stag again.,The place was amazing! It was very clean and open. The location was great. Couldn‚Äôt fault it. We will definitely be back!!!,Perfect !,We loved our stay ! <br/>We travel to Bali regularly and this would be our favourite Seminyak villa so far! <br/>Looks even better in real life. <br/>Gardens are lovely, the pool is perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è great temperature, deep and very large. The communal space is large with a very comfy lounge, plenty of day beds, options for shady or sunny spots! A nice functional kitchen. <br/>The bedrooms are all very large and the 2 bathrooms are nice! <br/>The locations is perfect! So central to shopping, food, beach‚Ä¶ the cafe across the corner is a lovely spot for breakfast too <br/>The staff are amazing! They all went above and beyond for us, from pre arrival shopping, ordering us a late meal for arrival and organising our laundry. <br/>Highly highly recommend this villa! We will DEFINITELY be back again ‚ù§Ô∏è,We had a great stay. The place was clean, rooms were large and air conditioned, the outdoor common areas were clean and lovely for lounging. It‚Äôs a perfect location to walk to restaurants and the night scene but is very calm and quiet in the evenings. The staff did a great job of organizing activities for us and everything we did through them was 5 stars. Highly recommend.,Stayed in this villa for 5 days with friends and it was one of the highlights of our trip! Love the open plan kitchen/living room and felt spacious. I couldnt fault it, slept well in the rooms, the pool was deep enough to swim and was so close to everything! We were close to the beach to walk and the main seminyak eat street. The staff were also amazing, really responsive, friendly and came every day to freshen the villa up every day. Would 100% recommend, thank you so much!,Had a very pleasant stay. Staff were attentive and very helpful. Beautiful pool and garden surrounding the villa and very clean rooms! Thank you so much. Had a good time staying. Staff are all lovely. Very nice and quite environment. Nice room and spacious bed. Had a minor issue as the television was not working on the last day and cannot be fixed on the same day. Definitely will be back again.,It's secluded, and all the restaurants and seaside are available on foot. It's good to rest at the accommodation as if you're just staying in Seminyak, and you can walk to the sea and go to the restaurant. At first, the location was a little difficult to understand, but the people who clean the accommodation did the laundry and were very friendly. The middle-aged man who guided me was also very kind. Good,So cozy and beautiful flat. Love the swimming pool and location was also good! Thanks!!,Absolutely loved this place and look forward to booking it again.<br/>Some tips for others staying here.<br/>The cold filtered water dispenser is excellent, saves forever looking for water. The gardens and pool are spacious, with no overlooking villas.The stereo box is excellent and connects to the phone via headset port (2.5mm jack) which was good for me but not good for the kids. <br/>Fantastic location  across the road  (Esquina) does good food and coffee but the best coffee is  about 250 meters away (Coffee Phora)  -  check it out! <br/>International power adapters in every room! (I didn't need to bring any).<br/>Good WiFi <br/>The rooms have beautiful lighting with artistic lamps but the light is low for reading at night. None of the hand basins have hot water (tricky when you're shaving). The showers have hot water. Floorboards upstairs creak a little bit downstairs. The distressed timber look is getting more \distressed\  -  and I'd hate to be the person who has to paint it because the place is huge :),Amazing villa, I‚Äôm super satisfied!,Great place to stay! <br/>Location is fantastic everything is close by and able to walk or there are lots of cars/bikes around if you would prefer.

The closets in each room are excellent and you could easily stay here for a week or more comfortably.<br/>The kitchen is stocked for basic needs- and the pool is small but deep- so great for an evening sip after a long day.

Since we had a car at our disposal, it did not made much of a difference. more so, grab was too quick for any late night adventure,We loved the home and the pool.  Would absolutely stay again. It‚Äôs an amazing property. Only downsides were that people came to the property almost daily (housekeeping, pool cleaning, yard cleaning) which was disruptive. I think those could be reduced in frequency. There is a daycare next door which was a great option for us traveling with a child but there is noise associated with that throughout the day during the week.,the stay was amazing and it looks exactly as shown on the listing! Beautiful villa and very comfortable. Spent most of the time hanging in the living room and had an amazing sleep as the bed was very comfy. Loved everything about the villa! One thing to take note, it‚Äôs located beside a kids school so on weekday mornings, there would be some singing and kids playing, but nothing overwhelming!

You may find plenty of various animals in Bali, ranging from the endangered exotic creature until common house animals you‚Äôve seen every day like Lizard and Gecko or small insects like ants and mosquitoes. We do our best to control mosquito population in our villa by doing fumigation once a month and clean the villa thoroughly every day but we cannot eradicate all. However, we always provide mosquito spray asper requestThe smell of sewage coming from underground is a common problem because it usually uses an underground water system, water that is slippery like foam is also a common problem in BaliThe entire property was established in 2010 , maintenance is still being carried out but not major repairs , this causes unpredictable cases to occur during your stay . You will find damp and cracked building walls in several places, rat can come if you're not close the door , leaves fall into the pool , water & electricity that goes out for 1-2 hours, water filter & swimming pool lights that only run for 6 hours a day, water flow is not heavy, trouble air-con , hot water only works 10 minutes and it will take 30 minutes to return, smelly water when turned on (using drilled water), the above can happen. if you have expectations with the facilities and conditions of the property when it is not a pandemic, then our property is not suitable for you. take a look at our review for reference !Please be advised that this is not a fresh building then its affect our furniture & cleanliness. Dust, leaves, twiges , spider webs , body of animals , or insects , eggs , and anything that can be carried by the wind can easily enter the outdoor areas, placing leftovers or food anywhere can also be easily visited by small animals such as ants and others. The tropical climate in Indonesia, especially in Bali, which is uncertain ( such as rain and heat ) also affects the quality of our buildings/ construction such as humidity, moss and mold , stains and rusts , even the quality of water in Bali also affects everything it passes through, such as tarnished iron and scale. You may also find parts of the doors, windows and walls that cannot be closed tightly (usually caused by guests who stayed before because they used it roughly) we cannot repair this case in one or two days to make repairs.These things cannot be avoided but we take care of them in step by step.","Great location walking distance to Restaurants and beach.<br/>Pool was good but cold as no sun gets in the area, and the self contained kitchen needed a toaster.<br/>Other than that all was good.,I‚Äôll be back!

Loved it !,Nice stay and very friendly staff, but room was a little dated and unclean ie cracking paint and hair in shower drain (not ours) and mould. Overall very lovely and reasonable for the price.,great as always. Thanks,Very dirty place with very unpleasant location. It‚Äôs located on a side road with local stores and houses. A lot of street dogs and lots of garbage on the street itself. Very messy, very dirty. The price is high for what you are getting. The water in the pool was dirty, the bathtub was dirty, there were stains everywhere. I felt like its better to go home to work and make more money, then have such a miserable stay. Probably, the worth place that we booked so far. I would recommend to stay away.,Place is outstanding, really impressed with the in-room pool and overall ambience. Location is really close to airport hence will save you the fuss of travelling far to catch flights. Stayed for 3 nights and impressed with the place and service.,This place is close to the airport and convenient for short stays. If you want to head to Seminyak or Legian daily then the location might seem far, but we wanted a place close to airport so this worked. <br/>Due to heavy rains the in-villa pool overflowed one night. The on-duty staff wasn't helpful but when the main host was informed of the issue he immediately arranged for an alternate room for us.,Place was great. Nice private pool and a decently sized place for two people. Address on air BnB wasn‚Äôt the exact location which made it hard to find without data.,Gorgeous villa!! Very clean! Floating bfast not so good and too many mosquitoes but would still stay again,,I want to first say that the staff were  absolutely wonderful. This place is maybe okay for 2-3 day stay, but no more. First floor was not functional at all. Pool was at constant threat of overflow, and did overflow twice in the same day, flooded the floor and wetted the mattress. It also meant that we could not use the pool due to overflow. First floor was practically unuseable. Description implies someone could sleep there. No way. Rain, insects and overflow will ruin you. The second floor was okay, but wet upon arrival. We checked 3 units, all wet. The housekeeping did not close the windows when it rained. Rooms were unprepped upon arrival with ten days in advance of booking. The windows do not close very tight on some units, which allow gaps where insects can enter. However, the bed does have curtains which do a decent job at deterring insects. But that‚Äôs it. The bed is literally the only safe space. But not really because the sheets and linens were stained and dirty.,I like the private pool so much, the staff there are very nice,100%,The place is comfortable for a staycation..but it's good if the wifi signal is strengthened again so that if we work in the room the signal is not disturbed..,it's easy to find by google maps. just, the lighting to the location if it's quite dark in the evening, it's good to becareful what else if it's raining. no complain, it's just a bit dim-lit in the room (maybe you can add bright lights, that's all.)<br/>there is a welcome drink, the staff who serve is also very friendly.<br/>keep up the good work.,What a hidden gem in the heart of seminyak.<br/>Close to Motel Mexicola, Pub and restaurants.,The inn is clean, adequate amenities and a friendly host,The village is clean bgt<br/>Rapii also<br/>And the location isn't difficult there are d maps üòÅ<br/>Only kmrn ac d one of the rooms has leaked<br/>Maybe you can double check üôèüèº<br/>But the others are okee ü•∞ü•∞",2,-8.73126933,115.1677593,3,FALSE,"Entire villa,1 bed,1 bath","Check-in: 2:00 PM - 10:00 PM,Checkout before 12:00 PM,3 guests maximum","Self check-in,value:You can check in with the building staff.,Great location,value:100% of recent guests gave the location a 5-star rating.,Dive right in,value:This is one of the few places in the area with a pool.",Venus Villa Kuta Near to Beach & Airport,17572,India

Super quiet- trasport from the airport was great- grab struggled to find the address though. <br/>Unfortunately the place wasn‚Äôt ready for 2pm check in.

Walking distance to the beach little bit far but we enjoyed the walks with our baby. Streets are not so stroll friendly but doable. Location quite calm with other villas around (where one evening a party was celebrated). Did not disturb us much. Villa is difficult to find because the streets there are very small for cars, but still manageable. We really liked the open architecture of the villa, the pool and the friendly cleaning service.

Yet you can still walk 30 seconds down the road and be in the midst of restaurants, bars & spas! <br/>We absolutely loved it and would highly recommend it!,The location of the Villa is perfect if you like crowds but you, you also want to be able to separate. The space is large, the beds are nice, communication good. The villa looks a little \less good\ in person than in the photos, but you should not stop that from staying for a few nights.,Overall, we had a fantastic stay at this villa! <br/>The location is right in the heart of seminyak, close to shops, restaurants, and cafes. We loved having breakfast at Bloom just across the street. The villa itself was clean, quiet, and well-maintained. The daily housekeeping service was great, keeping everything fresh and tidy throughout our stay. Laundry service is available next door, an added convenience!<br/>Access: The villa is located on a narrow alley, it has quiet atmosphere, though challenging for larger car access. We rented MPV and had some difficulty navigating the alley.<br/>Parking: only 2 shared parking spaces for the whole area. It's a bit of a first-come, first-served situation, so keep that in mind when you're traveling with 2 cars or more.<br/>Despite these, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this villa. The location and amenities were fantastic, and the cleanliness and daily housekeeping were amazing.  For the price and location, it was a great value!,The host is very accommodating.,Very nice stay in the villa , the villa was really beautiful and a housekeeper came by every day to clean , I recommend 100%, so Mr G was very responsive and very kind!,Our experience at Villa Rio exceeded all expectations!

The pool was a highlight, providing a refreshing escape after a day of exploring. Despite the heat outside, the rooms were always cool and comfortable thanks to the excellent air conditioning. Special mention to the cleaner who provided top-notch service, ensuring we had fresh towels and linen every day. The staff were fast and responsive to any queries we had, making our stay stress-free and enjoyable. Overall, Villa Rio provided us with a fantastic and comfortable stay, and we would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area. We can't wait to return!,Nice and clean. Great villa!,Pros<br/>- location was fairly near the Seminyak and Double Six beach<br/>- Bintang Supermarket was nearby<br/>- streets are lined with stores and restaurants<br/>- good service<br/>- spacious villa<br/>Cons<br/>- on the first night of our stay, there was a bad smell coming from our toilets. Mr G managed to fix it but the smell came back on our last night there.<br/>- facilities seemed old and dirty. the walls and floors had stains here and there. pool looked dirty (had particles floating around in it). some of the towels they provided had stains.<br/>- we didnt have hot water for one of the shower rooms. water pressure was poor. <br/>- tap water seemed dirty as well. water was cloudy from some of the taps.<br/>- if you're not a fan of insects, will probably not recommend this place to you<br/>Overall it's a pretty spacious villa but it probably needs some maintenance around the place. Mr G was nevertheless, very responsive to my feedback.,Our stay at this Bali retreat was truly exceptional in every way. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality by the incredible staff, whose attentive service elevated our experience to new heights.<br/>The villa itself was a haven of comfort and luxury, with every detail carefully crafted to ensure a memorable stay. From the plush furnishings to the stunning outdoor area, we felt pampered and rejuvenated throughout our time here. The private pool was a particular highlight, offering a refreshing escape from the Bali heat.<br/>The location was perfect for exploring all that Bali has to offer, with plenty of local attractions and dining options within easy reach.

From mirrors to lighting and privacy! It‚Äôs a quiet area and I enjoy feeling at home,Very good accommodation. Very nice and friendly with the patio. The kitchen was well-equipped and everything was as advertised. However, I must point out that there is no hot water in the shower. But no problem for me. Communication with Dea was very effective. Thank you. Definitely recommend.,Loved my stay here! It looked exactly like the pictures, they think was the only windows in the room being to the lobby so not much privacy with the curtains open. The common areas are amazing and the WiFi works well to work. The location is perfect, super quite but just a 2min walk to be in the main street.,Dea's place is very close to the Kuta beach. So you can easily reach it with just a 10 minute bike ride from the apartment. Also, the location was extremely good with many shops of all kinds surrounding it so you do not need to ride very long to find the things you want. She also has a quite large swimming pool on the upper floor. The apartment itself is very spacious with lots of amenities. The bed was quite large and the wardrobe also had ample space to put all items. There is a small kitchen too for heating up or cooking food. Dea herself is  very responsive to texts and was very helpful to inform us about anything we asked for. All in all a great place to stay in if you visit Bali. I would absolutely recommend this place for singles or couples who are looking for an affordable place in Bali.,Great central location. greatd communication throughout the checkin process and throughout our stay as required and  a very freindly team. Thanks Dee and the team.,was perfect accommodation for us, clean and spacious.<br/>very easy to check in but I didn't screenshot wifi password and had to turn on roaming to find out how to connect. A written password at the property would have been great.<br/>Walking distance to lots of places. Walk through the alley way to the busy road and grab a passing scooter or taxi for trips further afield.,Comfortable room to sleep in but might not be suitable for those who ride a car since its access is through a narrow alley. The AC takes time to turn cold and the water heater takes time to turn hot too, but not a problem for me! The wifi works well. Overall, it‚Äôs a great place to stay in and definitely worth the price!,10/10 I just wished I have neighbors downstairs. Kidding! üòÖ<br/>But, overall, it was a great stay at Studio 8d. Locals in neighboring are all as polite and accommodating as Dea. Love my room and the whole residence!,Room is perfect for a solo traveller or a couple. Tranquil environment amongst the busy streets nearby.<br/>The guidelines and communication was perfect, the listing is spot on, previous occupancy comments are valid too.<br/>I hired a scooter to get around, only due to my laziness for walking in the heat and the convenience for taking a short ride to the nearby large  Bintang supermarket, as well as the beach, instead of walking 15mins.<br/>The Air Con does work, albeit weak, however the room is in the shade all day.<br/>WiFi can occasionally drop but consistent enough to work and watch movies without being annoying.<br/>A young gentleman does the housekeeping weekly(I had a month's stay), he was very professional.<br/>Kitchen had all the basic amenities, shower room too.<br/>Bed was very comfortable.<br/>Cute pool upwards too.<br/>Quite literally what you see in the photos of this rooms listing is exactly what you get.<br/>*I'm returning back here for sure!!.,This time I stayed at 8d studio for more than a month, the experience was very good, like staying in my own home, although Bali basically all hotels and homestays were very humid, including star hotels, but this exception, it seems that there was a special treatment on the wall, it was very comfortable to stay, the host was also very responsible and responsive, everything was fully equipped, and the equipment was fully equipped, because it was still falling for the fattening period, the rice fried here was comparable More, so basically I've been cooking by myself for more than a month. The kitchen is very convenient. You don't need to buy your own gas. The stove top goes directly to the gas outside the house. The gas cylinder is not in the room. It's very safe. When the host called someone to clean it, he probably saw us taking bath towels as a curtain to block the kitchen. The next time we cleaned it, we changed the Chinese windy curtains, and it was still painted with Chinese wind and ink paintings. Dragon, so cute host, hahahahahaha, the only bad thing is that there are really too many cockroaches on the first floor, almost every day, I've lived in the north of China, I haven't seen cockroaches as big as I know in my life, we bought our own cockroach spray, the effect is not very good, and finally asked the landlord for help, he seems to have a lot of camphor in the house and put a lot of camphor in and out of the house. The effect Very good, these are difficult to avoid in Bali, if you are afraid of cockroaches, it is recommended to choose the room on the second floor, cockroaches rarely climb up, it will be much better, the location is easy to find according to the address given by the host, it is very convenient to go everywhere here, you can find takeaway and taxi app, if you stay for a long time, it will be much more convenient to rent a motorbike, it will be much more convenient to go to the supermarket for shopping, this side is a lot away Several local supermarkets are not far away. Anyway, I love this place. If I consider staying in Kuta again next time, I will choose this place. Thank you for your hospitality. I wish you a prosperous business!<br/>Here are a few things to keep in mind that we'd like to help new tenants:<br/>1. The water outlet in the bathroom may be black when you first check in, because the pipes on this side will be rusted if there are no people staying for a few days. Don't be afraid to see that the faucet is big, and the water will be better for a while, or you can use the water in the kitchen first to wash up. I feel that the water in the kitchen is filtered, and it will be cleaner.<br/>2. Don't take a shower too late, there may be no hot water. I asked the landlord before. They seem to sometimes choose to put water on the water tanks in the middle of the night. At that time, there may be no hot water, so try to take a bath before 12 o'clock, and it's not water going up every day. We stayed for about two times in a month or so.<br/>3. If the kitchen stove is not on fire, there is no gas. Tell the landlord that he will find someone to change it quickly. It will be fine in five minutes.<br/>4. Do not leave food and tableware outside, cockroaches smell and smell will come, put them in the cabinet after washing, and the food scraps on the table need to be cleaned in time, otherwise it will attract ants.<br/>That's probably it. Hopefully this will help you.,Was very nice, a little hidden but everything straightforward:),A wonderful oasis in the sometimes loud Kuta area. I used the spot to work from home. Zero noise. Very nice space. Open and bright colors. No sunlight but they have a roof top swimming pool for that. Decorated very nice with super comfy bed. Kitchen had everything I needed. Very safe as you are inside a \compound\ locked. Neighborhood so you have that added level of security plus you can get easy groceries and such from the neighborhood at good prices. Is a wonderful spot I would rent it again with certainty.,Very nice place. <br/>Unfortunately, some bad smell. <br/>Pool and common area are very nice! <br/>We would come again for the money.,Very Nice Stay,Clean and simple room, common space. Dea was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay here,We had an amazing time at Deas place. The apartment is very nice and clean, also the common areas. <br/>Lovely pool in the rooftop.,Very nice, cozy living. A large square, in the kitchen there is all you need. <br/>Of the small disadvantages - not the most stable Internet(movies are better than watching online) and poor ventilation - windows only to a small courtyard,  but saves air conditioning. The bathroom door doesn't close tightly.,Very low wi-fi connection (at the last day there wasn't connection at all and I couldn't to work). Also there was not so clean kitchen (a lot of dust on cutlery and shelves).

I stayed in the bungalow and there was mold in the bathroom and outside the entrance to the faucet. It was so uncomfortable because it wasn't soundproofed at all with the next room, and the sound of the plane was so good that I was able to sleep. Warm water is limited, so the back person came out cold when washing. The pillow cover smelled less laundry, so I asked for an exchange, and they changed it right away.

Our kids loved the pool, perfect place to relax. <br/>Our lovely housekeeper prepared a fabulous floating breakfast, one of the highlights of our stay.<br/>Roni was very accommodating, especially on our last night when our flight was delayed, he still took the time out on a Sunday to drive us to the airport,We really enjoyed our time at the villa. Mosquito spray is good to have but easily managed. We made sure to take a whole day just to spend our time in the villa and pool. Very gorgeous and we'd be happy to stay there or another of Roni's properties the next time we find ourselves in Bali!!,We LOVED our stay here.<br/>Roni is a great Airbnb host. Airport pickup was seamless, he was super responsive with communication particularly when we had a power issue, and was flexible in allowing us a late check out for our evening flight.<br/>The apartment was exactly what we wanted. Looks just like the pictures. The beds were huge, though a bit firm. The outdoor shower was great, but for us the highlight was the pool, in which we spent most of the trip.<br/>It is centrally located in Seminyak with the beach a short walk away and plenty of good places to eat nearby. <br/>We would highly recommend this villa and would look to book again when we return to Bali. <br/>Thanks Roni!,thanks Roni the cleaner who comes every day is fantastic the gardener was also very friendly the place was a vibe thanks again,Roni is a wonderful host, very kind and helpful, always responding immediately. He went far beyond his duty to make my stay memorable.<br/>The place is a real  well maintained Balinese villa with the famous outside bathroom I  utmostly love ( there also was an inside one ), hidden, surrounded by a small jungle; a rare gem, serene and so beautiful,  in the very middle of the city, lots of good shopping and eating places, and next to the beach. I felt so relaxed  and home every minute. These kind of heritage  villas are really difficult to find. I was extremely lucky .I've been in Bali many times, and fortunately they still exist. In fact I had the chance to stay there 2 times during my Indonesian trip.<br/>Even if there was construction nearby ( with very fair hours), it didn't bother me at all, being in the middle of a hectic city means always a bit of noise, especially in Asia. I can't thank Roni and his team enough for staying in this paradise.,Fantastic place, amazing host.,Great location! Beautiful villa couldn't fault anything other than the construction next door but that started and finished in reasonable hours. Roni great to communicate with, would stay again.,Right in the middle of all the action!,Such a great Villa, spent our first two nights here whilst recovering from jet lag. Our son loved the pool and outdoor living, it was a great set-up that worked perfectly for us.,Excellent base for couples and friends, Roni is exactly the reason we return to Bali! A scholar of a man! Will definitely be staying again.<br/>Thanks to him and his team for making it such a effortless holiday ü´∂üèº,A must book. Villa is excellently located and everything you need in the area. Roni is incredibly responsive and attentive as well.,The place was nice and clean, conveniently located and private. We had very good communications with Roni at all times. I definitely recommend!,VIla Soluna is a great place to base your stay in Bali. A short walk to the beach and set amongst restaurants, shops beauty and massage all at your doorstep. The Villa itself is well equipped and is perfect for the tropical climate. I spent a lot of time in the pool. <br/>Roni is a very good host, answered any queries quickly and helped to organise transport to and from the airport. I‚Äôd happily stay here again.,Loved our stay. Roni is a brilliant host. So accomodating, very responsive. Drove us all the way to Ubud on our final day. <br/>The airbnb is perfect for couples or friends. 2 big rooms. Big private pool, outdoor kitchen with basic facilities. The downstairs bathroom had a lot of insects as they are open bathrooms. Upstairs room was a little more comfortable. The bed is very hard, not great for someone with back problems but overall really enjoyable stay. The shops are very close, 66 beach is walking distance. Loved food at PaPa Lee‚Äôs noodles and dumplings. ü•ü great stay. Highly recommended.,the villa was good,Roni was such a lovely and accommodating host and extremely responsive! Villa is in an excellent location, within walking distance to the main road, shops, mini mart and restaurants! Really enjoyed our stay, Thankyou so much Roni :),Great holiday. Roni couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful.,A perfect place in Bali! The place looks just like the pictures but is even more! Lovely space, two bedrooms with en-suites, and of course the pool.<br/>Unit is in walking distance to everything, including the beach. <br/>Roni was extremely responsive to a couple small issues that we had and is a great host!,If you‚Äôre looking for the perfect indoor/outdoor villa in Bali, this place is a great choice! Both bedrooms are very spacious and have decent air conditioning. Roni was always super responsive and helped us organise transport to the villa. There's a maid that comes around pretty much every day, so everything is always super clean. The main kitchen/living area is outside so mosquitoes and ants can be a little bit of an issue. Roni and his team do provide insect repellent and mosquito incense coils, but I‚Äôd invest in some heavy-duty repellent (e.g., includes deet). We found spraying the rooms at night and keeping bathroom/bedroom doors closed helped a lot. The outdoor experience also included chirping geckos at night! So if you‚Äôre a light sleeper just be aware of that. We stayed here for a week and had an amazing time, I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for accommodation in Seminyak :),We loved our 5 night stay at Roni‚Äôs Place. Perfect location and accessible to everything-beach, restaurants and shopping etc.<br/>The villa is very spacious and comfortable.

The villa is difficult to locate, grab & Gojek won‚Äôt be able to find us. We need to walk out to the main road <br/>2. One of the rooms in the villa has issue with the water flow in the bathroom. Informed the management and they came to check, they said is due to uneven tiles. We noticed water marks on the wall which means they knew this issue and still never fix it or inform us. The water flowed til the bedroom causing us a lot of inconvenience. Their solution was just by ‚Äòstuffing towels between the door‚Äô. <br/>3. The pool is FILTHY, no way u would dip inside the pool. <br/>4. All the showers have issues, either water pressure is slow or no hot water <br/>5. One of the bedroom has issue with the lock for both room & toilet which is so inconvenient because we rented the villa with work colleagues. <br/>Overall, it was a horrible and uncomfortable stay. Won‚Äôt come back again.,My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Villa Balika! Although we primarily used the villa for sleeping, it perfectly met our needs. The location is excellent, with numerous restaurants just a short walk away. Dewa was fantastic, ensuring a smooth check-in and check-out process and answering all our questions. Putu was incredibly kind, helping us keep the villa clean and making sure we were well taken care of. While the buildings could benefit from some renovation due to noticeable water damage, this did not detract from our enjoyment of the villa. I would happily stay here again when visiting Canggu.,a beautiful villa with well equipped kitchen and a large dining area. All the rooms are big with space for storing clothes and luggage and private bathrooms. Close to shops and restaurants but secluded and private. Many thanks to Dewa who looked after us.

The conceirge was so helpful and would respond straight away to any to requests or queries. Everyone was really lovely. The villa was great. All the rooms were amazing, each had their own bathroom.
